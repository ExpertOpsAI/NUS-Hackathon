{"prompt": "What is the current standard of care for EGFR-mutant NSCLC?", "completion": "The current standard of care for EGFR-mutant NSCLC includes the use of third-generation EGFR inhibitors like osimertinib. The FLAURA trial (NEJM 2018) demonstrated that osimertinib significantly improved progression-free survival compared to earlier-generation EGFR inhibitors. Additionally, the ADAURA trial (NEJM 2020) supported its use in the adjuvant setting."}
{"prompt": "What are the side effects of pembrolizumab in lung cancer patients?", "completion": "Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 therapy, commonly causes immune-related side effects, including pneumonitis, colitis, and dermatitis. The KEYNOTE-024 trial (Lancet 2016) highlighted these adverse events. In cases of severe toxicity, corticosteroids are often required to manage symptoms."}
{"prompt": "Can you suggest a treatment plan for a patient with stage III NSCLC who is not a candidate for surgery?", "completion": "For stage III NSCLC patients who are not surgical candidates, concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by durvalumab as consolidation therapy is the standard approach. The PACIFIC trial (NEJM 2017) showed that durvalumab significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival in these patients."}
{"prompt": "How do I manage a patient with ALK-positive NSCLC who progresses on alectinib?", "completion": "For patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who progress on alectinib, switching to lorlatinib is recommended. The CROWN trial (NEJM 2020) demonstrated lorlatinib’s efficacy in overcoming resistance to earlier ALK inhibitors. It's essential to perform repeat molecular testing to confirm ALK mutation status."}
{"prompt": "What is the role of chemotherapy in the era of targeted therapy for NSCLC?", "completion": "Chemotherapy remains a key component of treatment for NSCLC, particularly for patients without actionable mutations. The KEYNOTE-189 trial (NEJM 2018) demonstrated that the combination of chemotherapy with pembrolizumab significantly improved survival in non-squamous NSCLC. Chemotherapy is also often used in the second-line setting after targeted therapies."}
{"prompt": "Can you provide guidance on treating an elderly patient with NSCLC?", "completion": "In elderly patients with NSCLC, treatment should be tailored based on performance status and comorbidities. The IFCT-0501 trial (Lancet 2011) demonstrated that carboplatin-based doublets can be used safely in elderly patients. For those with poor performance status, monotherapy with drugs like vinorelbine or supportive care may be more appropriate."}
{"prompt": "What are the long-term outcomes for patients treated with osimertinib for EGFR-mutant NSCLC?", "completion": "Long-term outcomes for patients treated with osimertinib are promising, with many achieving several years of progression-free survival. The AURA3 trial (Lancet Oncol 2017) reported a median progression-free survival of 10.1 months in the second-line setting, while the FLAURA trial (NEJM 2018) showed a median progression-free survival of 18.9 months in the first-line setting."}
{"prompt": "What is the latest data on PD-L1 as a biomarker for immunotherapy in lung cancer?", "completion": "PD-L1 expression remains a key biomarker for selecting patients for immunotherapy. The KEYNOTE-042 trial (Lancet 2019) highlighted that patients with PD-L1 expression ≥50% benefit the most from pembrolizumab monotherapy. However, other factors like tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) are also being explored as predictive markers."}
{"prompt": "How do I manage a patient with NSCLC who has brain metastases?", "completion": "For patients with NSCLC and brain metastases, treatment options include targeted therapy for those with actionable mutations, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). The ALEX trial (NEJM 2017) demonstrated that alectinib is effective in controlling brain metastases in ALK-positive NSCLC. For EGFR-mutant patients, osimertinib has shown good CNS penetration and is often preferred."}
{"prompt": "What clinical trials are available for KRAS-mutant NSCLC?", "completion": "Several clinical trials are exploring novel therapies for KRAS-mutant NSCLC. The CodeBreaK 100 trial (NEJM 2021) investigated the use of sotorasib, a KRAS G12C inhibitor, showing promising efficacy. Ongoing trials like CodeBreaK 200 and 300 are further evaluating combination strategies with sotorasib."}
{"prompt": "How do I choose between pembrolizumab and nivolumab for my lung cancer patients?", "completion": "Pembrolizumab and nivolumab are both PD-1 inhibitors with similar efficacy in NSCLC. The choice often depends on factors like PD-L1 expression and previous treatments. The CheckMate-017 and CheckMate-057 trials (NEJM 2015) demonstrated nivolumab’s efficacy in the second-line setting, while the KEYNOTE-024 trial (Lancet 2016) supported pembrolizumab in the first-line setting for high PD-L1 expressors."}
{"prompt": "What is the impact of smoking history on immunotherapy outcomes in lung cancer?", "completion": "Smoking history has been associated with better outcomes in patients receiving immunotherapy for lung cancer. The CheckMate-026 trial (NEJM 2017) indicated that smokers tend to have higher tumor mutational burden (TMB), which correlates with improved response to immunotherapy. However, smoking cessation remains critical for overall patient health and reducing the risk of secondary malignancies."}
{"prompt": "How should I manage immune-related adverse events in lung cancer patients on checkpoint inhibitors?", "completion": "Management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) involves early detection and intervention. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for moderate to severe irAEs. The ASCO guidelines (JCO 2018) recommend starting with high-dose steroids for grade 3-4 toxicity. In refractory cases, additional immunosuppressive agents like infliximab may be considered."}
{"prompt": "What is the role of adjuvant therapy in resected NSCLC?", "completion": "Adjuvant therapy in resected NSCLC is recommended for patients with stage II and III disease. The ADAURA trial (NEJM 2020) demonstrated that osimertinib significantly reduces the risk of recurrence in patients with resected EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Additionally, adjuvant chemotherapy remains the standard of care for patients without actionable mutations, based on the results of the ANITA trial (JCO 2006)."}
{"prompt": "How do I decide between surgery and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for early-stage NSCLC?", "completion": "The decision between surgery and SBRT for early-stage NSCLC depends on patient fitness and tumor characteristics. The STARS and ROSEL trials (Lancet Oncol 2015) demonstrated that SBRT is a viable alternative to surgery in patients with poor surgical candidacy, offering comparable local control with fewer complications. However, surgery remains the standard for operable patients."}
{"prompt": "What factors should I consider when selecting a first-line treatment for small cell lung cancer (SCLC)?", "completion": "First-line treatment for SCLC typically includes platinum-based chemotherapy combined with etoposide. Recent studies, such as the IMpower133 trial (NEJM 2018), have shown that adding atezolizumab to this regimen improves overall survival. Factors like patient performance status, comorbidities, and the extent of disease should be considered when tailoring the treatment plan."}
{"prompt": "What are the emerging therapies for BRAF-mutant NSCLC?", "completion": "Emerging therapies for BRAF-mutant NSCLC include BRAF inhibitors like dabrafenib combined with MEK inhibitors like trametinib. The BRF113928 trial (Lancet Oncol 2016) demonstrated the efficacy of this combination in treating BRAF V600E-mutant NSCLC, leading to its approval. Ongoing trials are exploring novel combinations and sequencing strategies."}

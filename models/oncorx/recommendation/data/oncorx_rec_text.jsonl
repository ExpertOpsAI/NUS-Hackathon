Withhold MEKINIST for Grade 3\nhemorrhagic events; if improved, resume MEKINIST at the next lower dose level.\n5.3       Colitis and Gastrointestinal Perforation\nColitis and gastrointestinal perforation, including fatal outcomes, have been reported in\npatients taking:\nMEKINIST Monotherapy and Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult): In the pooled safety\npopulation [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], colitis occurred in < 1% of patients and\ngastrointestinal perforation occurred in < 1% of patients.\nMEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric): In the pooled safety population,\ncolitis events occurred in <1% of patients.\nMonitor patients closely for colitis and gastrointestinal perforations.\n5.4       Venous Thromboembolic Events\nMEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult): In the pooled safety population [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)], deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)\noccurred in 2% of patients.\nMEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric): In the pooled safety population,\nembolism events occurred in < 1% of patients.\nAdvise patients to immediately seek medical care if they develop symptoms of DVT or\nPE, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. Permanently\ndiscontinue MEKINIST for life-threatening PE. Withhold MEKINIST for uncomplicated DVT\nand PE for up to 3 weeks; if improved, MEKINIST may be resumed at a lower dose level\n[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\n5.5       Cardiomyopathy\nCardiomyopathy, including cardiac failure, can occur with MEKINIST.\nMEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult): In the pooled safety population [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)], cardiomyopathy, defined as a decrease in left ventricular\nejection fraction (LVEF) \u2265 10% from baseline and below the institutional lower limit of\nnormal (LLN), occurred in 6% of patients. Development of cardiomyopathy resulted in\ndose interruption or discontinuation of MEKINIST in 3% and < 1% of patients,\nrespectively. Cardiomyopathy resolved in 45 of 50 patients who received MEKINIST\nadministered with dabrafenib.\nMEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric): In the pooled safety population,\ncardiomyopathy, defined as a decrease in LVEF \u2265 10% from baseline and below the\ninstitutional LLN, occurred in 9% of patients.\nAssess LVEF by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan before initiation\nof MEKINIST as a single agent or with dabrafenib, one month after initiation, and then at\n2- to 3-month intervals while on treatment. For an asymptomatic absolute decrease in\nLVEF of 10% or greater from baseline that is below the LLN, withhold MEKINIST for up to\n4 weeks. If improved to normal LVEF value, resume MEKINIST at a lower dose. If no\nimprovement to normal LVEF value within 4 weeks, permanently discontinue MEKINIST.\nFor symptomatic cardiomyopathy or an absolute decrease in LVEF of greater than 20%\nfrom baseline that is below LLN, permanently discontinue MEKINIST [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.4)].\n5.6       Ocular Toxicities\nRetinal Vein Occlusion\nIn the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] of MEKINIST monotherapy,\nthe incidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) was 0.6%. In the pooled safety population\n[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, there were no\ncases of RVO. RVO may lead to macular edema, decreased visual function,\nneovascularization, and glaucoma.\nUrgently (within 24 hours) perform ophthalmological evaluation for patient-reported loss\nof vision or other visual disturbances. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST in patients with\ndocumented RVO [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\nRetinal Pigment Epithelial Detachment\nRetinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED) can occur with MEKINIST. Retinal\ndetachments may be bilateral and multifocal, occurring in the central macular region of\nthe retina or elsewhere in the retina. In melanoma and NSCLC trials, routine monitoring\nof patients to detect asymptomatic RPED was not conducted; therefore, the true\nincidence of this finding is unknown.\nMEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric): In the pooled safety population,\nRPED events occurred in < 1% of patients.\nPerform ophthalmological evaluation periodically and at any time a patient reports visual\ndisturbances. Withhold MEKINIST if RPED is diagnosed. If resolution of the RPED is\ndocumented on repeat ophthalmological evaluation within 3 weeks, resume MEKINIST at\nsame or reduced dose. If no improvement after 3 weeks, resume MEKINIST at reduced\ndose or permanently discontinue MEKINIST [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\n5.7       Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis\nIn the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] of MEKINIST monotherapy,\ninterstitial lung disease or pneumonitis occurred in 2% of patients. In the pooled safety\npopulation [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, ILD\nor pneumonitis occurred in 1% of patients.\nWithhold MEKINIST in patients presenting with new or progressive pulmonary symptoms\nand findings, including cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, pleural effusion, or infiltrates, pending\nclinical investigations. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for patients diagnosed with\ntreatment-related ILD or pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\n5.8       Serious Febrile Reactions\nSerious febrile reactions and fever of any severity accompanied by hypotension, rigors\nor chills, dehydration, or renal failure, can occur when MEKINIST is administered with\ndabrafenib.\nMEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult): In the pooled safety population [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)], fever occurred in 58% of patients. Serious febrile reactions\nand fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration or\nrenal failure occurred in 5% of patients. Fever was complicated by hypotension in 4%,\ndehydration in 3%, syncope in 2%, renal failure in 1%, and severe chills/rigors in < 1% of\npatients.\nMEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric): In the pooled safety population [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)], pyrexia occurred in 66% of patients.\nWithhold MEKINIST when used as monotherapy, and both MEKINIST and dabrafenib\nwhen used in combination, if the patient\u2019s temperature is \u2265 100.4\u00b0F. In case of\nrecurrence, therapy can also be interrupted at the first symptom of pyrexia [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)]. Fever may be complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills,\ndehydration, or renal failure. Evaluate for signs and symptoms of infection and monitor\nserum creatinine and other evidence of renal function during and following severe\npyrexia. If appropriate, MEKINIST, or both MEKINIST and dabrafenib when used in\ncombination, may be restarted if the patient has recovered from the febrile reaction for\nat least 24 hours, either at same or lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\nAdminister antipyretics as secondary prophylaxis when resuming MEKINIST if patient\nhad a prior episode of severe febrile reaction or fever associated with complications.\nAdminister corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 10 mg daily) for at least 5 days for second\nor subsequent pyrexia if temperature does not return to baseline within 3 days of onset\nof pyrexia, or for pyrexia associated with complications, such as dehydration,\nhypotension, renal failure, or severe chills/rigors, and there is no evidence of active\ninfection.\n5.9       Serious Skin Toxicities\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome\n(SJS) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which can be\nlife-threatening or fatal, have been reported during treatment with MEKINIST\nadministered with dabrafenib [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].\nMEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult): In the pooled safety population [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)], other serious skin toxicity occurred in < 1% of patients.\nMEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric): In the pooled safety population,\nserious adverse events of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders occurred in 1.8% of\npatients.\nMonitor for new or worsening serious skin reactions. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST\nfor SCARs [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. For other skin toxicities, withhold\nMEKINIST for intolerable or severe skin toxicity. Resume MEKINIST at a lower dose in\npatients with improvement or recovery from skin toxicity within 3 weeks. Permanently\ndiscontinue MEKINIST if skin toxicity has not improved in 3 weeks [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.4)].\n5.10       Hyperglycemia\nMEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult): In the pooled safety population [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)], 15% of patients with a history of diabetes who had received\nMEKINIST with dabrafenib required more intensive hypoglycemic therapy. Grade 3 and\nGrade 4 hyperglycemia occurred in 2% of patients.\nMEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric): In the pooled safety population,\nGrade 3 and Grade 4 hyperglycemia events occurred in < 1% of patients.\nMonitor serum glucose levels upon initiation and as clinically appropriate when MEKINIST\nis administered with dabrafenib in patients with preexisting diabetes or hyperglycemia.\nInitiate or optimize anti-hyperglycemic medications as clinically indicated.\n5.11       Risks Associated with Combination Treatment\nMEKINIST is indicated for use in combination with dabrafenib. Review the prescribing\ninformation for dabrafenib for information on the serious risks of dabrafenib prior to\ninitiation of MEKINIST with dabrafenib.\n5.12       Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has been observed in the post-marketing\nsetting when MEKINIST was administered with dabrafenib. If HLH is suspected, interrupt\ntreatment. If HLH is confirmed, discontinue treatment and initiate appropriate\nmanagement of HLH.\n5.13       Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, MEKINIST can cause\nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Trametinib was embryotoxic and\nabortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures\napproximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended adult clinical dose.\nAdvise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of\nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with MEKINIST\nand for 4 months after treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].\n6       ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the\nlabeling:\nNew Primary Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \nHemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \nColitis and Gastrointestinal Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \nVenous Thromboembolic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] \nCardiomyopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] \nOcular Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] \nInterstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] \nSerious Febrile Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] \nSerious Skin Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] \nHyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]\nHemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]\nThere are additional adverse reactions associated with dabrafenib. Refer to the\ndabrafenib prescribing information for additional information.\n6.1       Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nAdult Safety Pools\nThe pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects\nexposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily as a single agent in 329 patients with\nvarious solid tumors enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Among these\n329 patients who received MEKINIST as a single agent, 33% were exposed for 6 months\nor longer and 9% were exposed for greater than one year.\nThe pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects\nexposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily administered in combination with\ndabrafenib 150 mg orally, twice daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in COMBI-d, COMBI-v,\nCOMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant\nmelanoma or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received MEKINIST administered\nwith dabrafenib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for\ngreater than one year.\nPediatric Safety Pool\nThe pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\nreflects exposure to weight-based MEKINIST orally, once daily administered in\ncombination with dabrafenib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center,\nopen-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive\nglioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-\nlabel, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors\nwith MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)].\nAmong 166 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 85% were\nexposed for 6 months and 69% were exposed for greater than one year. The most\ncommon (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%),\nvomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea\n(30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%),\nand dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory\nabnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine\naminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%).\nUnresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma\nMEKINIST as a Single Agent\nThe safety of MEKINIST was evaluated in the METRIC study, a randomized, open-label\ntrial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic\nmelanoma who received MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy\n(N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1000 mg/m  every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m  every\n3 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute\ncoronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater\ncongestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded. The median\nduration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months.\nIn this study, 9% of patients who received MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions\nresulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most frequent adverse\nreactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased LVEF,\npneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions\nin 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most\nfrequent reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST.

In\nboth trials, patients received MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg\norally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Both trials excluded\npatients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months,\nc\nd\ne\nf\na\na\nhistory of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association),\nhistory of RVO or RPED, QTcB interval \u2265 480 msec, uncontrolled hypertension,\nuncontrolled arrhythmias, active brain metastases, or known history of glucose-6-\nphosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].\nAmong these 559 patients, 197 (35%) were exposed to MEKINIST for > 6 months to 12\nmonths while 185 (33%) were exposed to MEKINIST for > 1 year. The median age was\n55 years (range: 18 to 91), 57% were male, and 98% were White, 72% had baseline\nECOG performance status of 0 and 28% had ECOG performance status of 1, 64% had\nM1c disease, 35% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at baseline, and 0.5% had\na history of brain metastases.\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) for MEKINIST in patients who received\nMEKINIST plus dabrafenib in the COMBI-d and COMBI-v studies were: pyrexia, nausea,\nrash, chills, diarrhea, vomiting, hypertension, and peripheral edema.\nThe demographics and baseline tumor characteristics of patients enrolled in the COMBI-\nd study are summarized in Clinical Studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients who\nreceived MEKINIST plus dabrafenib had a median duration of exposure of 11 months\n(range: 3 days to 30 months) to MEKINIST. Among the 209 patients who received\nMEKINIST plus dabrafenib, 26% were exposed to MEKINIST for > 6 months to\n12 months while 46% were exposed to MEKINIST for > 1 year.\nIn the COMBI-d study, adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of MEKINIST\noccurred in 11% of patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib; the most frequent\nwere pyrexia (1.4%) and decreased ejection fraction (1.4%). Adverse reactions leading\nto dose reductions of MEKINIST occurred in 18% of patients who received MEKINIST\nplus dabrafenib; the most frequent were pyrexia (2.9%), neutropenia (1.9%), decreased\nejection fraction (1.9%), and rash (1.9%). Adverse reactions leading to dose\ninterruptions of MEKINIST occurred in 46% of patients who received MEKINIST plus\ndabrafenib; the most frequent were pyrexia (18%), chills (7%), vomiting (6%), and\ndecreased ejection fraction (4.8%).\nTable 8 and Table 9 present selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities,\nrespectively, of MEKINIST observed in the COMBI-d study.\nTable 8.

Because these reactions are reported\nvoluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably\nestimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\nCardiac: Atrioventricular block complete. This adverse reaction was also observed with\nMEKINIST monotherapy.\nImmune System: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) [see Warnings and\nPrecautions (5.12)]\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue: SCAR (including DRESS and SJS) [see Warnings and\nPrecautions (5.9)]\n7       DRUG INTERACTIONS\nMEKINIST is indicated for use in combination with dabrafenib. Refer to the dabrafenib\nprescribing information for additional risk information that applies to combination use\ntreatment.\na\n8       USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1       Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] and findings from\nanimal reproduction studies, MEKINIST can cause fetal harm when administered to a\npregnant woman. There is insufficient data in pregnant women exposed to MEKINIST to\nassess the risks. Trametinib was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits at doses\ngreater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 0.3 times the\nhuman exposure at the recommended adult clinical dose (see Data). Advise pregnant\nwomen of the potential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nIn reproductive toxicity studies, administration of trametinib to rats during the period of\norganogenesis resulted in decreased fetal weights at doses greater than or equal to\n0.031 mg/kg/day [approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended\nadult dose based on area under the curve (AUC)]. In rats, at a dose resulting in\nexposures 1.8-fold higher than the human exposure at the recommended adult dose,\nthere was maternal toxicity and an increase in post-implantation loss.\nIn pregnant rabbits, administration of trametinib during the period of organogenesis\nresulted in decreased fetal body weight and increased incidence of variations in\nossification at doses greater than or equal to 0.039 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.08\ntimes the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC). In rabbits\nadministered trametinib at 0.15 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.3 times the human\nexposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC) there was an increase in post-\nimplantation loss, including total loss of pregnancy, compared with control animals.\n8.2       Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of trametinib in human milk, or the effects of\ntrametinib on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for\nserious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during\ntreatment with MEKINIST and for 4 months following the last dose.\n8.3       Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating MEKINIST.\nContraception\nBased on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action, MEKINIST can cause\nfetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nFemales\nAdvise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during\ntreatment with MEKINIST and for 4 months after the last dose.\nMales\nTo avoid potential drug exposure to pregnant partners and female partners of\nreproductive potential, advise male patients (including those who have had vasectomies)\nwith female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with\nMEKINIST and for 4 months after the last dose.\nInfertility\nFemales\nAdvise female patients of reproductive potential that MEKINIST may impair fertility.\nIncreased follicular cysts and decreased corpora lutea were observed in female rats at\ndose exposures equivalent to 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended adult\ndose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n8.4       Pediatric Use\nBRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors and LGG\nThe safety and effectiveness of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib have been\nestablished in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with unresectable or metastatic\nsolid tumors with BRAF V600E mutation who have progressed following prior treatment\nand have no satisfactory alternative treatment options; or with LGG with BRAF V600E\nmutation who require systemic therapy. Use of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib\nfor these indications is supported by evidence from studies X2101 and G2201 that\nenrolled 171 patients (1 to < 18 years) with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced solid\ntumors, of which 4 (2.3%) patients were 1 to < 2 years of age, 39 (23%) patients were\n2 to < 6 years of age, 54 (32%) patients were 6 to < 12 years of age, and 74 (43%)\npatients were 12 to < 18 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical\nPharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)].\nThe safety and effectiveness of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib have not been\nestablished for these indications in pediatric patients less than 1 year old.\nThe safety and effectiveness of MEKINIST as a single agent in pediatric patients have not\nbeen established.\nJuvenile Animal Toxicity Data\nIn a repeat-dose toxicity study in juvenile rats, decreased bone length and corneal\ndystrophy were observed at doses resulting in exposures as low as 0.3 times the\nhuman exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC. Additionally, a delay in\nsexual maturation was noted at doses resulting in exposures as low as 1.6 times the\nhuman exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC.\n8.5       Geriatric Use\nOf the 214 patients with melanoma who received single agent MEKINIST in the METRIC\nstudy, 27% were aged 65 years and older and 4% were over 75 years old [see Clinical\nStudies (14.1)]. This study of single agent MEKINIST in melanoma did not include\nsufficient numbers of geriatric patients to determine whether they respond differently\nfrom younger adults.\nOf the 994 patients with melanoma who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib in the\nCOMBI-d, COMBI-v, and COMBI-AD studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)], 21% were\naged 65 years and older and 5% were aged 75 years and older. No overall differences in\nthe effectiveness of MEKINIST plus dabrafenib were observed in geriatric patients as\ncompared to younger adults across these melanoma studies. The incidences of\nperipheral edema (26% vs. 12%) and anorexia (21% vs. 9%) increased in geriatric\npatients as compared to younger adults in these studies.\nOf the 93 patients with NSCLC who received MEKINIST in Study BRF113928, there were\ninsufficient numbers of geriatric patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they\nrespond differently from younger adults [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].\nOf the 26 patients with ATC who received MEKINIST in Study BRF117019, 77% were\naged 65 years and older and 31% were aged 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies\n(14.4)]. This study in ATC did not include sufficient numbers of younger adults to\ndetermine whether they respond differently compared to geriatric patients.\n8.6       Hepatic Impairment\nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (bilirubin \u2264 upper limit of\nnormal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > ULN or bilirubin > 1x to 1.5x ULN\nand any AST) hepatic impairment.\nA recommended dosage of MEKINIST has not been established for patients with\nmoderate (bilirubin > 1.5x to 3x ULN and any AST) or severe (bilirubin > 3x to 10x ULN\nand any AST) hepatic impairment. Consider the risk-benefit profile of MEKINIST related to\ndosing prior to determining whether to administer MEKINIST to patients with moderate\nor severe hepatic impairment.\nIn patients with moderate hepatic impairment, 3 patients who received a starting dose of\n1.5 mg orally once daily and two patients who received a starting dose of 2 mg orally\nonce daily did not experience dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first cycle of\ntherapy.\nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, 3 patients who received a starting dose of 1\nmg orally once daily did not experience DLTs during the first cycle; one patient who\nreceived a starting dose of 1.5 mg orally once daily experienced a DLT (grade 3\nacneiform rash).\nCompared to patients with normal hepatic function, there was no increase in exposure\nof trametinib in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.3)].\n10       OVERDOSAGE\nThe highest doses of MEKINIST evaluated in clinical trials were 4 mg orally once daily and\n10 mg administered orally once daily on 2 consecutive days followed by 3 mg once daily.\nIn seven patients treated on one of these two schedules, there were two cases of\nRPEDs for an incidence of 28%.\nSince trametinib is highly bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is likely to be\nineffective in the treatment of overdose with MEKINIST.\n11       DESCRIPTION\nTrametinib dimethyl sulfoxide is a kinase inhibitor. The chemical name is acetamide, N-[3-\n[3-cyclopropyl-5-[(2-fluoro-4- iodophenyl)amino]-3,4,6,7-tetrahydro-6,8-dimethyl- 2,4,7-\ntrioxopyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-1(2H)-yl]phenyl]-, compound with 1,1\u2019-sulfinylbis[methane]\n(1:1). It has a molecular formula C\nH\nFIN O \u2022C H OS with a molecular mass of\n693.53 g/mol. Trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide has the following chemical structure:\nTrametinib dimethyl sulfoxide is a white to almost white powder. It is practically insoluble\nin the pH range of 2 to 8 in aqueous media.\nMEKINIST (trametinib) tablets for oral use are supplied as 0.5 mg and 2 mg tablets for\noral administration. Each 0.5 mg tablet contains 0.5635 mg trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide\nequivalent to 0.5 mg of trametinib non-solvated parent. Each 2 mg tablet contains\n2.254 mg trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide equivalent to 2 mg of trametinib non-solvated\nparent.\nThe inactive ingredients of MEKINIST tablets are: Tablet Core: colloidal silicon dioxide,\ncroscarmellose sodium, hypromellose, magnesium stearate (vegetable source),\nmannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium lauryl sulfate. Coating: hypromellose,\niron oxide red (2 mg tablets), iron oxide yellow (0.5 mg tablets), polyethylene glycol,\npolysorbate 80 (2 mg tablets), and titanium dioxide.\nMEKINIST (trametinib) for oral solution is a white or almost white powder which\nproduces a clear colorless solution when reconstituted with water. Each bottle contains\n4.7 mg of trametinib equivalent to 5.3 mg trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide. Each mL of\nreconstituted trametinib solution contains 0.05 mg of trametinib non-solvated parent.\nThe inactive ingredients of MEKINIST for oral solution are betadex sulfobutyl ether\nsodium, citric acid monohydrate, dibasic sodium phosphate, methylparaben, potassium\nsorbate, sucralose, and strawberry flavor.\n12       CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1       Mechanism of Action\nTrametinib is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated\nkinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 activation and of MEK1 and MEK2 kinase activity. MEK\nproteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)\npathway, which promotes cellular proliferation. BRAF V600E mutations result in\nconstitutive activation of the BRAF pathway which includes MEK1 and MEK2. Trametinib\n26\n23\n5\n4\n2\n6\ninhibits cell growth of various BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors in vitro and in vivo.\nTrametinib and dabrafenib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK\npathway. Use of trametinib and dabrafenib in combination resulted in greater growth\ninhibition of BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumor cell lines in vitro and prolonged inhibition\nof tumor growth in BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumor xenografts compared with\neither drug alone.\nIn the setting of BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer, induction of EGFR-mediated MAPK\npathway re-activation has been identified as a mechanism of intrinsic resistance to BRAF\ninhibitors [see Indications and Usage (1.7)].\n12.2       Pharmacodynamics\nAdministration of MEKINIST tablets 1 mg and 2 mg to patients with BRAF V600 mutation-\npositive melanoma resulted in dose-dependent changes in tumor biomarkers, including\ninhibition of phosphorylated ERK, inhibition of Ki67 (a marker of cell proliferation), and\nincreases in p27 (a marker of apoptosis).\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nThe heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) prolongation potential of trametinib was assessed in a\ndedicated study in 32 patients who received placebo on Day 1 and MEKINIST tablets 2\nmg once daily on Days 2-14 followed by MEKINIST tablets 3 mg on Day 15. No large\nchanges in the mean QTc interval (i.e., > 20 ms) were detected in the study.\nA decrease from baseline in HR by 9 beats/min (90% CI: -11.4 to -6.1) and an increase\nfrom baseline in PR by 20 ms (90% CI: 13.0 to 27.4) relative to placebo was observed at\ntwo hours post-dose in the same study.\nIn clinical trials in patients who received MEKINIST with dabrafenib, QTc prolongation >\n500 ms occurred in 0.8% of patients and QTc increased by > 60 ms from baseline in\n3.8% of patients.\n12.3       Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of trametinib were characterized following a single dose and\nmultiple doses in patients with solid tumors and BRAF V600 mutation-positive metastatic\nmelanoma. Following administration of MEKINIST tablets 0.125 mg (0.0625 times the\napproved recommended adult dosage) to 4 mg (2 times the approved recommended\nadult dosage) daily, both C\n and AUC increase proportionally with dose. Inter-subject\nvariability in AUC and C\n at steady state is 22% and 28%, respectively.\nAbsorption\nThe median time to achieve peak plasma concentrations (T\n) is 1.5 hours post-dose.\nThe mean absolute bioavailability of MEKINIST tablets is 72% and MEKINIST for oral\nsolution is 81%.\nEffect of Food\nFollowing administration of MEKINIST tablets, a high-fat, high-calorie meal (approximately\n1000 calories) decreased trametinib AUC by 24%, C\n by 70%, and delayed T\n by\napproximately 4 hours as compared with fasted conditions.\nDistribution\nmax\nmax\nmax\nmax\nmax\nTrametinib is 97.4% bound to human plasma proteins. The apparent volume of\ndistribution (V /F) is 214 L.\nElimination\nThe estimated elimination half-life is 3.9 to 4.8 days. The apparent clearance is 4.9 L/h.\nMetabolism\nTrametinib is metabolized predominantly via deacetylation alone or with mono-\noxygenation or in combination with glucuronidation biotransformation pathways in vitro.\nDeacetylation is mediated by carboxylesterases (i.e., carboxylesterase 1b/c and 2) and\nmay also be mediated by other hydrolytic enzymes.\nFollowing a single dose of [\nC]-trametinib, approximately 50% of circulating radioactivity\nis represented as the parent compound; however, \u2265 75% of drug-related material in\nplasma is the parent compound based on metabolite profiling after repeat dosing of\ntrametinib.\nExcretion\nFollowing oral administration of [\nC]-trametinib, greater than 80% of excreted\nradioactivity was recovered in the feces while less than 20% of excreted radioactivity\nwas recovered in the urine with less than 0.1% of the excreted dose as parent.\nSpecific Populations\nAge (18 to 93 years), sex, body weight (36 to 170 kg), and renal impairment (eGFR 15\nto 89 mL/min/1.73 m ) have no clinically significant effect on the exposure of trametinib.\nThere are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the exposure of trametinib\nby race or ethnicity.\nPediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of trametinib in glioma and other solid tumors\nwere evaluated in 244 patients aged 1 to < 18 years following a single dose or multiple\ndoses. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients aged 1 to < 18 years are within range of\nvalues previously observed in adults given the same dose based on weight. Weight (6 to\n156 kg) was found to have a statistically significant effect on trametinib oral clearance in\nthis population.\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment: Hepatic impairment (defined by bilirubin and AST\nlevels) had no significant effect in trametinib exposure or apparent drug clearance\ncompared with patients with normal hepatic function.\nDrug Interaction Studies\nEffect of Dabrafenib on Trametinib: Coadministration of MEKINIST tablets 2 mg daily with\ndabrafenib resulted in no change in AUC of trametinib.\nEffect of Trametinib on CYP Substrates: Coadministration of MEKINIST tablets 2 mg once\ndaily with a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate had no clinically relevant effect on the AUC and\nC\n of the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate.\nBased on in vitro studies, trametinib is an inhibitor of CYP2C8, but is not an inhibitor of\nCYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 at a clinically relevant systemic\nconcentration.\nEffect of Transporters on Trametinib: Trametinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)\nand BSEP. Inhibition of P-gp is unlikely to result in a clinically important increase in\nc\n14\n14\n2\nmax\ntrametinib concentrations as trametinib exhibits high passive permeability and\nbioavailability. Trametinib is not a substrate of BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1,\nOCT1, MRP2, or MATE1 in vitro.\nEffect of Trametinib on Transporters: Based on in vitro studies, trametinib is not an\ninhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, BSEP, MRP2, or\nMATE1 at a clinically relevant systemic concentration.\n13       NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1       Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies with trametinib have not been conducted. Trametinib was not\ngenotoxic in studies evaluating reverse mutations in bacteria, chromosomal aberrations\nin mammalian cells, and micronuclei in the bone marrow of rats.\nTrametinib may impair fertility in humans. In female rats given trametinib for up to\n13 weeks, increased follicular cysts and decreased corpora lutea were observed at\ndoses \u2265 0.016 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the\nrecommended adult dose based on AUC). In rat and dog toxicity studies up to 13 weeks\nin duration, there were no treatment effects observed on male reproductive tissues [see\nUse in Specific Populations (8.3)].\n14       CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1       BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic\nMelanoma \nMEKINIST as a Single Agent\nThe safety and efficacy of MEKINIST were evaluated in an international, multi-center,\nrandomized (2:1), open-label, active-controlled trial (the METRIC study; NCT01245062) in\n322 patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive, unresectable or metastatic\nmelanoma. In the METRIC study, patients were not permitted to have more than one\nprior chemotherapy regimen for advanced or metastatic disease; prior treatment with a\nBRAF inhibitor or MEK inhibitor was not permitted. Patients were randomized to receive\nMEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily (N = 214) or chemotherapy (N = 108) consisting of\neither dacarbazine 1000 mg/m  intravenously every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m\nintravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment continued until disease progression or\nunacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified according to prior use of\nchemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease (yes vs. no) and LDH level (normal\nvs. greater than ULN). Tumor tissue was evaluated for BRAF mutations at a central\ntesting site using a clinical trial assay. Tumor samples from 289 patients (196 patients\ntreated with MEKINIST and 93 chemotherapy-treated patients) were also tested\nretrospectively using an FDA-approved companion diagnostic test, THxID -BRAF assay.\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS).\nThe median age for randomized patients was 54 years, 54% were male, greater than\n99% were White, and all patients had baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Most\npatients had metastatic disease (94%), had M1c disease (64%), had elevated LDH (36%),\nhad no history of brain metastasis (97%), and received no prior chemotherapy for\n2\n2\n\u00ae\nadvanced or metastatic disease (66%). The distribution of BRAF V600 mutations was\nBRAF V600E (87%), V600K (12%), or both (less than 1%). The median durations of\nfollow-up prior to initiation of alternative treatment were 4.9 months for patients treated\nwith MEKINIST and 3.1 months for patients treated with chemotherapy. Fifty-one (47%)\npatients crossed over from the chemotherapy arm at the time of disease progression to\nreceive MEKINIST.\nThe METRIC study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in PFS in the patients\ntreated with MEKINIST.

The COMBI-d study compared dabrafenib plus MEKINIST to dabrafenib\nplus placebo as first-line treatment for patients with unresectable (Stage IIIC) or\nmetastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma.\nPatients were randomized (1:1) to receive MEKINIST 2 mg once daily plus dabrafenib 150\nmg twice daily or dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily plus matching placebo. Randomization\nwas stratified by LDH level (> ULN vs. \u2264 ULN) and BRAF mutation subtype (V600E vs.\nV600K). The major efficacy outcome was investigator-assessed PFS per RECIST v1.1\nwith additional efficacy outcome measures of overall survival (OS) and confirmed overall\nresponse rate (ORR).\nIn the COMBI-d study, 423 patients were randomized to MEKINIST plus dabrafenib\n(n = 211) or dabrafenib plus placebo (n = 212). The median age was 56 years (range:\n22 to 89), 53% were male, > 99% were White, 72% had ECOG performance status of 0,\n4% had Stage IIIC, 66% had M1c disease, 65% had normal LDH, and 2 patients had a\nhistory of brain metastases. All patients had tumor containing BRAF V600E or V600K\nmutations as determined by centralized testing with the FDA-approved companion\ndiagnostic test; 85% had BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma and 15% had BRAF\nV600K mutation-positive melanoma.\nThe COMBI-d study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in PFS and OS.\nTable 21 and Figure 2 summarize the efficacy results.\nTable 21.

Kaplan-Meier Curves of Overall Survival in the COMBI-d Study\nCOMBI-MB Study\nThe activity of MEKINIST with dabrafenib for the treatment of BRAF V600E or V600K\nmutation-positive melanoma, metastatic to the brain, was evaluated in a non-\nrandomized, open-label, multi-center, multi-cohort trial (the COMBI-MB study;\nNCT02039947). Eligible patients were required to have at least one measurable\nintracranial lesion and to have no leptomeningeal disease, parenchymal brain metastasis\ngreater than 4 cm in diameter, ocular melanoma, or primary mucosal melanoma.\nPatients received MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice\ndaily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome\nmeasure was intracranial response rate, defined as the percentage of patients with a\nconfirmed intracranial response per RECIST v1.1, modified to allow up to five intracranial\ntarget lesions at least 5 mm in diameter, as assessed by independent review.\nThe COMBI-MB study enrolled 121 patients with a BRAF V600E (85%) or V600K (15%)\nmutation. The median age was 54 years (range: 23 to 84), 58% were male, 100% were\nWhite, 8% were from the United States, 65% had normal LDH at baseline, and 97% had\nan ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Intracranial metastases were asymptomatic in\n87% and symptomatic in 13% of patients, 22% received prior local therapy for brain\nmetastases, and 87% also had extracranial metastases.\nThe intracranial response rate was 50% (95% CI: 40, 60), with a complete response rate\nof 4.1% and a partial response rate of 46%. The median duration of intracranial\nresponse was 6.4 months (range: 1 to 31). Of the patients with an intracranial\nresponse, 9% had stable or progressive disease as their best overall response.\n14.2       Adjuvant Treatment of BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive\nMelanoma\nThe safety and efficacy of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib were evaluated in an\ninternational, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (COMBI-AD;\nNCT01682083) that enrolled patients with Stage III melanoma with BRAF V600E or\nV600K mutations as detected by the THxID -BRAF assay and pathologic involvement of\nregional lymph node(s). Enrollment required complete resection of melanoma with\ncomplete lymphadenectomy within 12 weeks prior to randomization. The trial excluded\npatients with mucosal or ocular melanoma, unresectable in-transit metastases, distant\nmetastatic disease, or prior systemic anti-cancer treatment, including radiotherapy.\nPatients were randomized (1:1) to receive MEKINIST 2 mg once daily in combination with\ndabrafenib 150 mg twice daily or two placebos for up to 1 year. Randomization was\nstratified by BRAF mutation status (V600E or V600K) and American Joint Committee on\nCancer (AJCC; 7\n Edition) Stage (IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC). The major efficacy outcome measure\nwas relapse-free survival (RFS) defined as the time from randomization to disease\nrecurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis), new primary melanoma, or death\nfrom any cause, whichever occurred first as assessed by the investigator. Patients\nunderwent imaging for tumor recurrence every 3 months for the first two years and\nevery 6 months thereafter.\nIn COMBI-AD, a total of 870 patients were randomized: 438 to the MEKINIST in\ncombination with dabrafenib and 432 to placebo. Median age was 51 years (range: 18 to\n89), 55% were male, 99% were White, and 91% had an ECOG performance status of 0.\nDisease characteristics were AJCC Stage IIIA (18%), Stage IIIB (41%), Stage IIIC (40%),\nstage unknown (1%); BRAF V600E mutation (91%), BRAF V600K mutation (9%);\nmacroscopic lymph nodes (65%); and tumor ulceration (41%). The median duration of\nfollow-up (time from randomization to last contact or death) was 2.8 years.\nCOMBI-AD showed a statistically significant improvement in RFS in patients randomized\nto MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib arm compared to those randomized to\nplacebo.

Key eligibility criteria were locally confirmed\nBRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC, no prior exposure to BRAF or MEK\ninhibitor, and absence of EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement (unless patients had\nprogression on prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy). Patients enrolled in Cohorts A\nand B were required to have received at least one previous platinum-based\nchemotherapy regimen with demonstrated disease progression but no more than three\nprior systemic regimens. Patients in Cohort C could not have received prior systemic\ntherapy for metastatic disease. Patients in Cohort A received dabrafenib 150 mg twice\ndaily. Patients in Cohorts B and C received MEKINIST 2 mg once daily and dabrafenib 150\nmg twice daily. The major efficacy outcome was ORR per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by\nindependent review committee (IRC) and duration of response.\na\nb\nThere were a total of 171 patients enrolled which included 78 patients enrolled in Cohort\nA, 57 patients enrolled in Cohort B, and 36 patients enrolled in Cohort C.

Patients with LGG (WHO grades 1 and 2) who\nrequired first systemic therapy were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to dabrafenib plus\ntrametinib (D + T) or carboplatin plus vincristine (C + V).\nBRAF mutation status was identified prospectively via a local assessment or a central\nlaboratory test. In addition, retrospective testing of available tumor samples by the\ncentral laboratory was performed to evaluate BRAF V600E mutation status.\nPatients received age- and weight-based dosing of MEKINIST and dabrafenib until loss of\nclinical benefit or until unacceptable toxicity. Carboplatin and vincristine were dosed\nbased on body surface area at doses 175 mg/m  and 1.5 mg/m  (0.05 mg/kg for\npatients < 12 kg), respectively, as one 10-week induction course followed by eight 6-\nweek cycles of maintenance therapy.\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) by independent\nreview based on RANO LGG (2017) criteria. Additional efficacy outcome measures were\nprogression-free survival and overall survival. The primary analysis was performed when\nall patients had completed at least 32 weeks of therapy.\nIn the LGG cohort, 110 patients were randomized to D + T (n = 73) or C + V (n = 37).\nMedian age was 9.5 years (range: 1 to 17); 60% were female.

In addition, nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting occurred in 89% of 366\npatients, including 9% Grade 3. Nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting led to dosage interruption\nor dose reduction in 29% of patients and permanent discontinuation of adagrasib in\nGrading defined by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI\nCTCAE) version 5.0.\nWhen KRAZATI is administered in combination with cetuximab, withhold or permanently\ndiscontinue treatment with cetuximab when withholding or permanently discontinuing treatment\nwith KRAZATI.\nPermanently\ndiscontinue KRAZATI\nWithhold KRAZATI if\nILD/pneumonitis is\nsuspected.\nPermanently\ndiscontinue KRAZATI if\nILD/pneumonitis is\nconfirmed\nWithhold KRAZATI until\n\u2264 Grade 1 or return to\nbaseline.\nResume KRAZATI at the\nnext lower dose level.\n0.3%.\nIn patients who received KRAZATI in combination with cetuximab [see Adverse\nReactions (6.1)], serious gastrointestinal adverse reactions included gastrointestinal\nbleeding in 8.5% including 1.1% Grade 3 or 4, gastrointestinal obstruction in 5.3%\nincluding 5.3% Grade 3 or 4, colitis in 1.1% including 1.1% Grade 3 and ileus in 1.1%. In\naddition, nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting occurred in 92% of 94 patients, including 6%\nGrade 3. Nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting led to adagrasib dose interruption or dose\nreduction in 23% of patients.\nMonitor and manage patients using supportive care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics,\nor fluid replacement, as indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently\ndiscontinue KRAZATI based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.2 QTc Interval Prolongation\nKRAZATI can cause QTc interval prolongation, which can increase the risk for ventricular\ntachyarrhythmias (e.g., torsades de pointes) or sudden death.\nIn the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] who received single-agent\nKRAZATI, 6% of 366 patients with at least one post-baseline electrocardiogram (ECG)\nassessment had an average QTc \u2265 501 msec and 11% of patients had an increase from\nbaseline of QTc > 60 msec. KRAZATI causes concentration-dependent increases in the\nQTc interval [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].\nIn patients who received KRAZATI in combination with cetuximab [see Adverse\nReactions (6.1)], 5% of 93 patients with at least one post-baseline electrocardiogram\n(ECG) assessment had an average QTc \u2265 501 msec and 16% of patients had an\nincrease from baseline of QTc > 60 msec.\nAvoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with other products with a known potential to\nprolong the QTc interval [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].\nAvoid use of KRAZATI in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with\nconcurrent QTc prolongation.\nMonitor ECGs and electrolytes, particularly potassium and magnesium, prior to starting\nKRAZATI, during concomitant use, and as clinically indicated in patients with congestive\nheart failure, bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients who are unable\nto avoid concomitant medications that are known to prolong the QT interval. Correct\nelectrolyte abnormalities. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue\nKRAZATI depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.3 Hepatotoxicity\nKRAZATI can cause hepatotoxicity, which may lead to drug-induced liver injury and\nhepatitis.\nIn the pooled safety population of 366 patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] who\nreceived single-agent KRAZATI, drug-induced liver injury was reported in 0.3% of\npatients, including 0.3% Grade 3. A total of 32% of patients who received adagrasib had\nincreased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST);\n5% were Grade 3 and 0.5% were Grade 4. The median time to first onset of increased\nALT/AST was 3 weeks (range: 0.1 to 48). Overall hepatotoxicity occurred in 37%, and\n7% were Grade 3 or 4. Hepatotoxicity leading to dose interruption or reduction occurred\nin 12% of patients. Adagrasib was discontinued due to hepatotoxicity in 0.5% of\npatients.\nIn patients who received KRAZATI in combination with cetuximab [see Adverse\nReactions (6.1)], 29% had increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/increased aspartate\naminotransferase (AST); 5% were Grade 3 and 1.1% were Grade 4. The median time to\nfirst onset of increased ALT/AST was 4 weeks (range: 0.1 to 27). Overall hepatotoxicity\noccurred in 38%, and 10% were Grade 3 or 4. Hepatotoxicity leading to adagrasib dose\ninterruption or reduction occurred in 12% of patients.\nMonitor liver laboratory tests (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin) prior to\nthe start of KRAZATI and monthly for 3 months or as clinically indicated, with more\nfrequent testing in patients who develop transaminase elevations. Reduce the dose,\nwithhold, or permanently discontinue KRAZATI based on severity [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n5.4 Interstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis\nKRAZATI can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, which can be fatal.\nIn the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] who received single-agent\nKRAZATI, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 4.1% of patients, 1.4% were Grade 3 or 4, and\none case was fatal. The median time to first onset for ILD/pneumonitis was 12 weeks\n(range: 5 to 31 weeks). Adagrasib was discontinued due to ILD/pneumonitis in 0.8% of\npatients.\nIn patients who received KRAZATI in combination with cetuximab [see Adverse\nReactions (6.1)], Grade 1 ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 1.1% of patients. The time to first\nonset for ILD/pneumonitis was 38 weeks.\nMonitor patients for new or worsening respiratory symptoms indicative of\nILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever) during treatment with KRAZATI. Withhold\nKRAZATI in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue\nKRAZATI if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the\nlabeling:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect\nexposure to adagrasib as a single agent at 600 mg orally twice daily in 366 patients with\nGastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nQTc Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nHepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\nInterstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]\nNSCLC and other solid tumors enrolled in KRYSTAL-1 and KRYSTAL-12 (NCT04685135),\nrespectively.

If concomitant use cannot be avoided, monitor\nelectrocardiogram and electrolytes prior to starting KRAZATI, during concomitant use,\nand as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Withhold KRAZATI if the\nQTc interval is > 500 ms or the change from baseline is > 60 ms [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3)].\nAdagrasib causes QTc interval prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].\nConcomitant use of KRAZATI with other products that prolong the QTc interval may\nresult in a greater increase in the QTc interval and adverse reactions associated with\nQTc interval prolongation, including Torsade de pointes, other serious arrythmias, and\nsudden death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nThere are no available data on the use of KRAZATI in pregnant women. In animal\nreproduction studies, oral administration of adagrasib to pregnant rats and rabbits\nduring the period of organogenesis did not cause adverse development effects or\nembryo-fetal lethality at exposures below the human exposure at the recommended\ndose of 600 mg twice daily (see Data).\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nIn a rat embryo-fetal development study, once daily oral administration of adagrasib to\npregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity (reduced\nbody weight and food intake, and adverse clinical signs leading to moribund condition\nand early termination) and lower fetal body weight at 270 mg/kg dose level\n(approximately 2 times the recommended dose of 600 mg twice daily based on body\nsurface area [BSA]). Adagrasib induced skeletal malformations, such as bent limbs, and\nskeletal variations, such as bent scapula, wavy ribs, and supernumerary short cervical\nribs at 270 mg/kg, which were secondary to maternal toxicity and reduced fetal body\nweight.\nIn a rabbit embryo-fetal development study, once daily oral administration of adagrasib\nduring the period of organogenesis resulted in lower fetal body weight and increased\nlitter frequency of unossified sternebra at 30 mg/kg (approximately 0.11 times the\nhuman exposure based on area under the curve [AUC] at the clinical dose of 600 mg\ntwice daily). This skeletal variation was associated with maternal toxicities, including\nreduced mean body weight and decreased food consumption. Adagrasib exposure did\nnot cause adverse developmental effects and did not affect embryo-fetal survival in\nrabbits at doses up to 30 mg/kg once daily.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of adagrasib or its metabolites in human milk, the\neffects on the breastfed child, or on milk production. Because of the potential for\nserious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during\ntreatment with KRAZATI and for 1 week after the last dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nInfertility\nBased on findings from animal studies, KRAZATI may impair fertility in females and males\nof reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of KRAZATI has not been established in pediatric patients.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 116 patients with metastatic NSCLC who received adagrasib 600 mg orally twice daily\nin KRYSTAL-1, 49% (57 patients) were \u2265 65 years of age and 13% (15 patients) were \u2265\n75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed\nbetween older and younger patients.\nOf 94 patients with metastatic CRC who received adagrasib 600 mg orally twice daily in\ncombination with cetuximab in KRISTAL-1, 33% (31 patients) were \u2265 65 years of age\nand 2.1% (2 patients) were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or\neffectiveness were observed between older and younger patients.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nAdagrasib is an irreversible inhibitor of KRAS G12C and belongs to the RAS GTPase\nfamily. The molecular formula is C\nH\nClFN O  and the molecular weight is 604.1 g/mol.\nThe chemical name is {(2S)-4-[7-(8-chloronaphthalen-1-yl)-2-{[(2S)-1-methylpyrrolidin-2-\nyl]- methoxy}-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-yl]-1-(2-fluoroprop-2-\nenoyl)piperazin-2-yl}acetonitrile. Adagrasib has the following chemical structure:\n32\n35\n7\n2\nAdagrasib is a crystalline solid. The solubility of adagrasib in the aqueous media\ndecreases over the range pH 1.2 to 7.4 from > 262 mg/mL to < 0.010 mg/mL.\nKRAZATI (adagrasib) tablets for oral administration contain 200 mg of adagrasib. The\nfollowing are inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, magnesium\nstearate (vegetable sourced), mannitol, and microcrystalline cellulose. The tablet film\ncoating contains hypromellose, maltodextrin, medium chain triglycerides (vegetable\nsourced), polydextrose, talc, and titanium dioxide.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nAdagrasib is an irreversible inhibitor of KRAS G12C that covalently binds to the mutant\ncysteine in KRAS G12C and locks the mutant KRAS protein in its inactive state that\nprevents downstream signaling without affecting wild-type KRAS protein. Adagrasib\ninhibited tumor cell growth and viability in cells harboring KRAS G12C mutations and\nresulted in tumor regression in KRAS G12C-mutated tumor xenograft models with\nminimal off-target activity. Adagrasib in combination with cetuximab had increased\nantitumor activity in some cell line-derived and patient-derived KRAS G12C-mutant CRC\ntumor xenograft models compared to adagrasib or cetuximab alone.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nAdagrasib exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic\nresponse are unknown.\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nAdagrasib increased QTc in a concentration-dependent manner. Based on the\nconcentration-QTcF relationship, the mean (90% CI) QTcF change from baseline (\u0394QTcF)\nwas 18 (15, 21) ms at the mean steady-state maximum concentration (C\n) in\npatients after administration of adagrasib 600 mg twice daily [see Warnings and\nPrecautions (5.2)].\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of adagrasib were studied in healthy subjects and in patients with\nmax,ss\nKRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC or CRC. Adagrasib pharmacokinetic data are presented as\nmean (percent coefficient of variation) unless otherwise specified.\nAdagrasib AUC and C\n increase dose proportionally over the dose range of 400 mg to\n600 mg (0.67 to 1 times the approved recommended dose). Adagrasib steady-state was\nreached within 8 days following administration of the approved recommended dosage\nand accumulation was approximately 6-fold.\nAbsorption\nThe median (min, max) T\n of adagrasib is approximately 6 (6, 12) hours.\nEffect of Food\nNo clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of adagrasib were observed\nfollowing administration of a high-fat and high-calorie meal (containing approximately\n900 to 1000 calories, 50% from fat).\nDistribution\nThe apparent volume of distribution of adagrasib is 942 L (57%). Human plasma protein\nbinding of adagrasib is approximately 98% in vitro.\nElimination\nThe adagrasib terminal elimination half-life is 23 hours (16%) and the apparent oral\nclearance (CL/F) is 37 L/h (54%) in patients.\nMetabolism\nAdagrasib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 following single dose administration.\nAdagrasib inhibits its own CYP3A4 metabolism following multiple dosing to steady-state\nwhich permits CYP2C8, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 to contribute to its\nmetabolism at steady-state.\nExcretion\nFollowing a single oral dose of radiolabeled adagrasib, approximately 75% of the dose\nwas recovered in feces (14% as unchanged) and 4.5% recovered in urine (2% as\nunchanged).\nSpecific Populations\nNo clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of adagrasib based on age\n(19 to 89 years), sex, race (White, Black or African American, or Asian), body weight (36\nto 146 kg), ECOG PS (0, 1), tumor type (NSCLC or CRC), or tumor burden. No clinically\nsignificant differences in the pharmacokinetics of adagrasib are expected in patients with\nmild to severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to < 90 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault\nequation) or in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A to\nC).\nDrug Interaction Studies\nClinical Studies and Model-Informed Approaches\nThe following table describes the effect of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of\nadagrasib.\nmax\nmax\nTable 7: Effect of Other Drugs on Adagrasib\nC\n = maximum plasma concentration; AUC = area under the plasma concentration-\ntime curve\n*\nConcomitant Drug\nAdagrasib Dosage\nChanges in C\n or AUC of\nAdagrasib\nC\n \n% Decrease\nAUC \n% Decrease\nRifampin\n(a strong CYP3A\ninducer)\n600 mg single dose\n88%\n95%\n600 mg multiple doses\n> 61%\n> 66%\nStrong CYP3A Inhibitors: Adagrasib C\n increased by 2.4-fold and AUC increased by 4-\nfold following concomitant use of a single dose of 200 mg (0.33 times the approved\nrecommended dose) with itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor). No clinically significant\ndifferences in the pharmacokinetics of adagrasib at steady state were predicted when\nused concomitantly with itraconazole.\nNo clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of adagrasib were predicted\nor observed when used concomitantly with efavirenz (a moderate CYP3A inducer),\npantoprazole (a proton pump inhibitor), or rosuvastatin (a BCRP/OATP substrate).\nThe following table describes the effect of adagrasib on the pharmacokinetics of other\ndrugs.\nTable 8: Effect of Adagrasib on Other Drugs\nC\n = maximum plasma concentration; AUC = area under the plasma concentration-\ntime curve\n*\n\u2020\nConcomitant Drug\nAdagrasib Dosage\nFold Increase of Concomitant\nDrug\nC\nAUC\nMidazolam\n(a sensitive CYP3A\nsubstrate)\n400 mg  twice daily\n4.8-fold\n21-fold\n600 mg twice daily\n3.1-fold\n31-fold\nWarfarin\n(a sensitive CYP2C9\nsubstrate)\n600 mg twice daily\n1.1-fold\n2.9-fold\nDextromethorphan\n(a sensitive CYP2D6\nsubstrate)\n400 mg  twice daily\n1.9-fold\n1.8-fold\n600 mg twice daily\n1.7-fold\n2.4-fold\nDigoxin\n(a P-gp substrate)\n600 mg twice daily\n1.9-fold\n1.5-fold\nIn Vitro Studies\nCytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: Adagrasib may inhibit CYP2B6.\nmax\nPredicted changes in C\n or AUC of adagrasib.\nmax\nmax\nmax\n*\n*\nmax\nmax\n0.66 times the approved recommended dosage.\nPredicted changes in C\n or AUC of concomitant drug.\nmax\nmax\n*\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n*\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\nTransporter Systems: Adagrasib may be a substrate of BCRP and may inhibit MATE-\n1/MATE-2K.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with adagrasib.\nAdagrasib was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and\nwas not genotoxic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay or an in vivo\nmicronucleus assay in rats.\nFertility studies were not conducted with adagrasib. In toxicology studies of up to 13-\nweeks in duration in rats, oral administration of adagrasib induced phospholipidosis\nwhich increased vacuolation in female reproductive organs, including vacuolation in\novaries (corpora lutea, macrophage or interstitial cells) and uterus (glandular epithelium),\nand atrophy with mucification of the vaginal mucosa at doses \u2265 150 mg/kg\n(approximately equal to or greater than the human exposure at the recommended dose\nbased on area under the curve [AUC]). These findings reversed after cessation of\ndosing in the 28-day study but in the 13-week study, pigmented macrophage\naggregates were observed in the ovaries of female rats after the recovery period. In a\n28-day repeat-dose toxicology study, oral administration of adagrasib to male rats\ninduced atrophy and epithelial vacuolation of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles at\n300 mg/kg (approximately 1.6 times the human exposure at the recommended dose\nbased on AUC). These findings resolved after cessation of treatment.\n13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nPhospholipidosis (vacuolation and/or presence of foamy macrophages) was observed in\nmultiple organs (e.g., lung, trachea, heart, skeletal, ovaries, uterus, adrenal gland,\nkidney, liver, lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, and thyroid in rats; and heart and lung in\ndogs) after repeated oral administration of adagrasib in rats and dogs. In toxicology\nstudies of up to 13-week duration in rats, phospholipidosis was observed at doses \u2265\n150 mg/kg (approximately \u2265 2 times the human exposure at the recommended dose\nbased on AUC). In a dog 28-day toxicity study, this effect was observed at 25 mg/kg\n(approximately equal to the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC).\nThe extent of vacuolization and the presence of foamy macrophages were more\nprominent in the rat compared to dogs, and evidence of reversibility after cessation of\ntreatment was noted for most organs. The significance of this finding in humans in\nunknown.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\nThe efficacy of adagrasib was evaluated in KRYSTAL-1 (NCT03785249), a multicenter,\nsingle-arm, open-label expansion cohort study. Eligible patients were required to have\nlocally advanced or metastatic KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC who previously received\ntreatment with a platinum-based regimen and an immune checkpoint inhibitor, an\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, and at\nleast one measurable lesion as defined by Response Evaluation criteria in Solid Tumors\n(RECIST v1.1). Identification of a KRAS G12C mutation was prospectively determined by\nlocal testing using tissue specimens. Patients received adagrasib 600 mg orally twice\ndaily until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Tumor assessments were\nperformed every 6 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed\nobjective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as evaluated by blinded\nindependent central review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1.\nIn the efficacy population, KRAS G12C mutation status was determined by prospective\nlocal testing using tumor tissue specimens. Of the 112 patients with KRAS G12C\nmutation, tissue samples from 88% (98/112) patients were tested retrospectively using\nthe QIAGEN therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit. While 89% (87/98) of patients were positive\nfor KRAS G12C mutation, 11% (11/98) did not have a KRAS G12C mutation identified. In\naddition, plasma samples from 63% (71/112) patients were tested retrospectively using\nAgilent Resolution ctDx FIRST assay. While 66% (47/71) of patients were positive for\nKRAS G12C mutation, 34% (24/71) did not have a KRAS G12C mutation identified.\nA total of 112 patients had at least one measurable lesion at baseline as assessed by\nBICR according to RECIST v1.1.\nThe baseline demographic and disease characteristics in the efficacy population were:\nmedian age 64 years (range: 25 to 89), 55% female, 83% White, 8% were Black or\nAfrican American, 4% Asian, 4% race not reported, 0.9% American Indian or Alaska\nNative, 16% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0\nand 83% ECOG PS 1. Tumor histology was 97% adenocarcinoma and 89% of patients\nhad metastatic disease. Patients received a median of 2 prior systemic therapies (range\n1 to 7); 43% received 1 prior line, 35% received 2 prior lines, 10% received 3 prior lines\nand 12% received 4 or more prior lines, 98% received both prior platinum and prior anti-\nPD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Sites of extra-thoracic disease included bone 42%, brain 30%,\nadrenals 21%, and liver 21%.\nEfficacy results are summarized in Table 9.\nTable 9: Efficacy Results for KRYSTAL-1\nCI = Confidence Interval\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\nEfficacy Parameter\nAdagrasib \n(n = 112)\nObjective Response Rate (95% CI)\n43 (34, 53)\n  Complete response rate, %\n0.9\n  Partial response rate, %\n42\nDuration of Response\n  Median  in months (95% CI)\n8.5 (6.2, 13.8)\n  Patients with duration \u2265 6 months , %\n58\n14.2 Colorectal Cancer\nThe efficacy of adagrasib in combination with cetuximab was evaluated in KRYSTAL-1, a\nmulticenter, single-arm, open-label expansion cohort study.

Tumor\nassessments were performed every 6 weeks. Adagrasib discontinuation required\ncetuximab discontinuation, however patients could continue to receive adagrasib if\ncetuximab was discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Six patients\ncontinued with adagrasib single agent therapy after discontinuing cetuximab. The length\nof time these 6 patients received adagrasib alone ranged from 43 days to 3 years.\nPatient treatment with adagrasib after disease progression continued if a patient was\nclinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator.\nThe major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed ORR and DOR according to\nRECIST v1.1 as assessed by BICR.\nIn the efficacy population, KRAS G12C mutation status was determined by prospective\nlocal testing using tumor tissue specimens. Of the 94 patients with KRAS G12C\nmutation, tissue samples from 79% (74/94) patients were tested retrospectively using\nthe QIAGEN therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit. Of the 74 tissue samples submitted, 81%\n(60/74) yielded a result with 93% (56/60) positive for KRAS G12C and 7% (4/60) without\na KRAS G12C mutation identified.\nThe baseline demographic and disease characteristics in the efficacy population were:\nmedian age 57 years (range: 24 to 75 years), 53% female, 71% White, 14% were Black\nor African American, 5% Asian, 1.1% American Indian or Alaska Native, 9% reported as\nother; 51% ECOG PS 0 and 49% ECOG PS 1.

Subsequent infusion time is approximately 2 hours.\n*\nvomiting.\nRYBREVANT with Carboplatin and Pemetrexed\nRYBREVANT in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed can cause infusion-related\nreactions. Based on the safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , infusion-\nrelated reactions occurred in 42% of patients treated with RYBREVANT in combination\nwith carboplatin and pemetrexed, including Grade 3 (1.3%) adverse reactions. The\nincidence of infusion modifications due to IRR was 40%, and 0.7% of patients\npermanently discontinued RYBREVANT.\nRYBREVANT as a Single Agent\nBased on the safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], IRR occurred in 66% of\npatients treated with RYBREVANT as a single agent. Among patients receiving treatment\non Week 1 Day 1, 65% experienced an IRR, while the incidence of IRR was 3.4%with the\nDay 2 infusion, 0.4% with the Week 2 infusion, and cumulatively 1.1% with subsequent\ninfusions. Of the reported IRRs, 97% were Grade 1\u20132, 2.2% were Grade 3, and 0.4%\nwere Grade 4. The median time to onset was 1 hour (range 0.1 to 18 hours) after start\nof infusion. The incidence of infusion modifications due to IRR was 62%, and 1.3% of\npatients permanently discontinued RYBREVANT due to IRR.\nPremedicate with antihistamines, antipyretics, and glucocorticoids and infuse\nRYBREVANT as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Administer\nRYBREVANT via a peripheral line on Week 1 and Week 2 [see Dosage and Administration\n(2.7)] .\nMonitor patients for any signs and symptoms of infusion reactions during RYBREVANT\ninfusion in a setting where cardiopulmonary resuscitation medication and equipment are\navailable. Interrupt infusion if IRR is suspected. Reduce the infusion rate or permanently\ndiscontinue RYBREVANT based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\n5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis\nRYBREVANT can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis.\nRYBREVANT with Carboplatin and Pemetrexed\nBased on the safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], Grade 3 ILD/pneumonitis\noccurred in 2.6% of patients treated with RYBREVANT in combination with carboplatin\nand pemetrexed, all patients required permanent discontinuation.\nRYBREVANT as a Single Agent\nBased on the safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , ILD/pneumonitis\noccurred in 3.3% of patients treated with RYBREVANT as a single agent, with 0.7 % of\npatients experiencing Grade 3 ILD/pneumonitis. Three patients (1%) discontinued\nRYBREVANT due to ILD/pneumonitis.\nMonitor patients for new or worsening symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g.,\ndyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold RYBREVANT in patients with suspected\nILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue if ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed [see\nDosage and Administration (2.5)] .\n5.3 Dermatologic Adverse Reactions\nRYBREVANT can cause rash (including dermatitis acneiform), pruritus and dry skin.\nRYBREVANT with Carboplatin and Pemetrexed\nRYBREVANT in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed can cause dermatologic\nadverse reactions. Based on the safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , rash\noccurred in 89% of patients treated with RYBREVANT in combination with carboplatin\nand pemetrexed, including Grade 3 (19%) adverse reactions. Rash leading to dose\nreductions occurred in 19% of patients, and 2% permanently discontinued RYBREVANT\nand 1.3% discontinued pemetrexed.\nRYBREVANT as a Single Agent\nBased on the safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , rash occurred in 74% of\npatients treated with RYBREVANT as a single agent, including Grade 3 rash in 3.3% of\npatients. The median time to onset of rash was 14 days (range: 1 to 276 days). Rash\nleading to dose reduction occurred in 5% of patients, and RYBREVANT was permanently\ndiscontinued due to rash in 0.7% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nToxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) occurred in one patient (0.3%) treated with\nRYBREVANT as a single agent.\nInstruct patients to limit sun exposure during and for 2 months after treatment with\nRYBREVANT. Advise patients to wear protective clothing and use broad-spectrum\nUVA/UVB sunscreen. Alcohol-free emollient cream is recommended for dry skin.\nIf skin reactions develop, start topical corticosteroids and topical and/or oral antibiotics.\nFor Grade 3 reactions, add oral steroids and consider dermatologic consultation.\nPromptly refer patients presenting with severe rash, atypical appearance or distribution,\nor lack of improvement within 2 weeks to a dermatologist. Withhold, dose reduce or\npermanently discontinue RYBREVANT based on severity [see Dosage and Administration\n(2.6)] .\n5.4 Ocular Toxicity\nRYBREVANT can cause ocular toxicity including keratitis, dry eye symptoms, conjunctival\nredness, blurred vision, visual impairment, ocular itching, and uveitis.\nRYBREVANT with Carboplatin and Pemetrexed\nBased on the safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] RYBREVANT in\ncombination with carboplatin and pemetrexed can cause ocular toxicity including\nblepharitis, dry eye, conjunctival redness, blurred vision, and eye pruritus. All events\nwere Grade 1\u20132.\nRYBREVANT as a Single Agent\nBased on the safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], keratitis occurred in 0.7%\nand uveitis occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with RYBREVANT. All events were Grade\n1\u20132. Promptly refer patients presenting with eye symptoms to an ophthalmologist.\nWithhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue RYBREVANT based on severity [see\nDosage and Administration (2.6)] .\n5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on its mechanism of action and findings from animal models, RYBREVANT can\ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of other\nEGFR inhibitor molecules to pregnant animals has resulted in an increased incidence of\nimpairment of embryo-fetal development, embryo lethality, and abortion. Advise females\nof reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of\nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months\nafter the last dose of RYBREVANT.

There are no available data\non the use of RYBREVANT in pregnant women or animal data to assess the risk of\nRYBREVANT in pregnancy. Disruption or depletion of EGFR in animal models resulted in\nimpairment of embryo-fetal development including effects on placental, lung, cardiac,\nskin, and neural development. The absence of EGFR or MET signaling has resulted in\nembryo lethality, malformations, and post-natal death in animals ( see Data) .Advise\npregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nNo animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of amivantamab-vmjw on\nreproduction and fetal development; however, based on its mechanism of action,\nRYBREVANT can cause fetal harm or developmental anomalies. In mice, EGFR is critically\nimportant in reproductive and developmental processes including blastocyst\nimplantation, placental development, and embryo-fetal/postnatal survival and\ndevelopment. Reduction or elimination of embryo-fetal or maternal EGFR signaling can\nprevent implantation, can cause embryo-fetal loss during various stages of gestation\n(through effects on placental development) and can cause developmental anomalies and\nearly death in surviving fetuses. Adverse developmental outcomes were observed in\nmultiple organs in embryos/neonates of mice with disrupted EGFR signaling. Similarly,\nknock out of MET or its ligand HGF was embryonic lethal due to severe defects in\nplacental development, and fetuses displayed defects in muscle development in multiple\norgans. Human IgG1 is known to cross the placenta; therefore, amivantamab-vmjw has\nthe potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus.\n8.2 Lactation\nThe denominator used to calculate the rate was 126 based on the number of\npatients with a baseline value and at least one post-treatment value.\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of amivantamab-vmjw in human milk, the effects on\nthe breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse\nreactions from RYBREVANT in breast-fed children, advise women not to breast-feed\nduring treatment with RYBREVANT and for 3 months after the last dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nRYBREVANT can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.1)].\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating\nRYBREVANT.\nContraception\nFemales\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment\nand for 3 months after the last dose of RYBREVANT.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and efficacy of RYBREVANT have not been established in pediatric patients.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the 151 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with RYBREVANT\nin combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed in the PAPILLON study, 37% were \u226565\nyears of age and 8% were \u226575 years of age.\nOf the 302 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with RYBREVANT\nas a single agent in the CHRYSALIS study, 39% were \u226565 years of age and 11% were\n\u226575 years of age.\nNo clinically important differences in safety or efficacy were observed between patients\nwho were \u226565 years of age and younger patients.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nAmivantamab-vmjw is a low-fucose human immunoglobulin G1-based bispecific antibody\ndirected against the EGF and MET receptors, produced by mammalian cell line (Chinese\nHamster Ovary [CHO]) using recombinant DNA technology that has a molecular weight\nof approximately 148 kDa. RYBREVANT \n(amivantamab-vmjw) injection for intravenous\ninfusion is a sterile, preservative-free, colorless to pale yellow solution in single-dose\nvials. The pH is 5.7.\nEach RYBREVANT vial contains 350 mg (50 mg/mL) amivantamab-vmjw, EDTA disodium\nsalt dihydrate (0.14 mg), L-histidine (2.3 mg), L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate\n(8.6 mg), L-methionine (7 mg), polysorbate 80 (4.2 mg), sucrose (595 mg), and water\nfor injection, USP.\n\u00ae\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nAmivantamab-vmjw is a bispecific antibody that binds to the extracellular domains of\nEGFR and MET.\nIn in vitroand in vivostudies amivantamab-vmjw was able to disrupt EGFR and MET\nsignaling functions through blocking ligand binding and, in exon 20 insertion mutation\nmodels, degradation of EGFR and MET. The presence of EGFR and MET on the surface\nof tumor cells also allows for targeting of these cells for destruction by immune effector\ncells, such as natural killer cells and macrophages, through antibody-dependent cellular\ncytotoxicity (ADCC) and trogocytosis mechanisms, respectively.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nThe exposure-response relationship and time-course of pharmacodynamic response of\namivantamab-vmjw have not been fully characterized in patients with NSCLC with EGFR\nexon 20 insertion mutations.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nBased on RYBREVANT single agent data, amivantamab-vmjw exposures increased\nproportionally over a dosage range from 350 to 1750 mg. Based on the population\npharmacokinetics of RYBREVANT, steady-state concentrations of RYBREVANT were\nreached by week 13 for both the 3-week and 2-week dosing regimen and the systemic\naccumulation was 1.9-fold.\nDistribution\nThe amivantamab-vmjw mean (\u00b1 SD) volume of distribution is 5.34 (\u00b1 1.81) L.\nElimination\nThe geometric mean (% CV) linear clearance (CL) and terminal half-life is 0.266 L/day\n(30.4%) and 13.7 days (31.9%), respectively.\nSpecific Populations\nNo clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of amivantamab-vmjw were\nobserved based on age (range: 27\u201387 years), sex, race, creatinine clearance (CLcr 29 to\n301 mL/min), or mild hepatic impairment [(total bilirubin \u2264 ULN and AST > ULN) or (ULN\n< total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times ULN)]. The pharmacokinetics of amivantamab-vmjw have not\nbeen studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min) or patients\nwith moderate (total bilirubin 1.5 to 3 times ULN) to severe (total bilirubin > 3 times ULN)\nhepatic impairment.\nBody Weight\nIncreases in body weight increased the volume of distribution and clearance of\namivantamab-vmjw. Amivantamab-vmjw exposures are 30\u201340% lower in patients who\nweighed \u2265 80 kg compared to patients with body weight < 80 kg at the same dose.\nExposures of amivantamab-vmjw were comparable between patients who weighed < 80\nkg and received 1050 mg dose and patients who weighed \u2265 80 kg and received 1400\nmg dose.\n12.6 Immunogenicity\nThe observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and\nspecificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons\nof the incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in the studies described below with the\nincidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of amivantamab-vmjw\nor amivantamab products.\nIn patients with NSCLC who received RYBREVANT as a single agent or as part of a\ncombination therapy, 3 of the 663 (0.5%) patients who were treated with RYBREVANT\nand evaluable for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) tested positive for\ntreatment-emergent anti-amivantamab-vmjw antibodies. Given the low incidence of\ndetectable antibody-drug antibodies, the effect of ADA on the efficacy of RYBREVANT\nremains unknown.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nNo studies have been performed to assess the potential of amivantamab-vmjw for\ncarcinogenicity or genotoxicity. Fertility studies have not been performed to evaluate the\npotential effects of amivantamab-vmjw. In 6-week and 3-month repeat-dose toxicology\nstudies in monkeys, there were no notable effects in the male and female reproductive\norgans.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 First Line Treatment of NSCLC with Exon 20 Insertion Mutations-\nPAPILLON\nThe efficacy of RYBREVANT was evaluated in PAPILLON (NCT04538664), in a\nrandomized, open-label, multicenter study. Eligible patients were required to have\npreviously untreated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR Exon 20 insertion\nmutations measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group\n(ECOG) performance status (PS) \u22641, and adequate organ and bone marrow function.\nPatients with brain metastases at screening were eligible for participation once they were\ndefinitively treated, clinically stable, asymptomatic, and off corticosteroid treatment for\nat least 2 weeks prior to randomization. Patients with a medical history of interstitial lung\ndisease or active ILD were excluded from the clinical study.\nA total of 308 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive RYBREVANT in combination with\ncarboplatin and pemetrexed (n=153) or carboplatin and pemetrexed (n=155). Patients\nreceived RYBREVANT intravenously at 1400 mg (for patients < 80 kg) or 1750 mg (for\npatients \u2265 80 kg) once weekly through 4 weeks, then every 3 weeks with a dose of\n1750 mg (for patients < 80 kg) or 2100 mg (for patients \u2265 80 kg) starting at Week 7\nuntil disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Carboplatin was administered\nintravenously at area under the concentration-time curve 5 mg/mL per minute (AUC 5)\nonce every 3 weeks, for up to 12 weeks. Pemetrexed was administered intravenously at\n500 mg/m on once every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\nPatients were stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance\nstatus (0 or 1) and prior brain metastases (yes or no).\n2\nstatus (0 or 1) and prior brain metastases (yes or no).\nThe primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed\nby blinded independent central review (BICR). Additional efficacy outcome measures\nincluded overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR) and overall survival\n(OS). Cross-over to single agent RYBREVANT was permitted for patients who had\nconfirmed disease progression on carboplatin and pemetrexed.\nThe median age was 62 (range: 27 to 92) years, with 40% of the patients \u2265 65 years of\nage; 58% were female; 61% were Asian and 36% were White, 0.7% were Black or\nAfrican American and race was not reported in 2.3% of patients; 93% were not Hispanic\nor Latino. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (35%) or 1 (65%); 58% were never\nsmokers; 23% had history of brain metastasis and 84% had Stage IV cancer at initial\ndiagnosis.\nPAPILLON demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression free\nsurvival for patients randomized to RYBREVANT in combination with carboplatin and\npemetrexed compared with carboplatin and pemetrexed.\nEfficacy results are summarized in Table 13 and Figure 1.\nTable 13: Efficacy Results in PAPILLON\nRYBREVANT+\ncarboplatin+\npemetrexed \n(N=153)\ncarboplatin+\npemetrexed \n(N=155)\nCI = confidence interval\n*\n\u2020\nProgression-Free Survival (PFS)\n  Number of events (%)\n84 (55)\n132 (85)\n  Median, months (95% CI)\n11.4 (9.8, 13.7)\n6.7 (5.6, 7.3)\n  HR (95% CI)\n0.40 (0.30, 0.53)\n  p-value\np<0.0001\nOverall Response Rate (ORR)\n  ORR, % (95% CI)\n67 (59, 75)\n36 (29, 44)\n  Complete response, %\n4\n1\n  Partial response, %\n63\n36\nDuration of response (DOR)\n  Median (95% CI), months\n10.1 (8.5, 13.9)\n5.6 (4.4, 6.9)\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier Curve of PFS in Previously Untreated NSCLC Patients\nby BICR Assessment \u2013 Papillon Study\nConfirmed responses.\nIn confirmed responders.\n*\n\u2020\nWhile OS results were immature at the current analysis, with 44% of pre-specified\ndeaths for the final analysis reported, no trend towards a detriment was observed.\nSeventy-five (48%) of the treated patients crossed over from the carboplatin and\npemetrexed arm after confirmation of disease progression to receive RYBREVANT as a\nsingle agent.\n14.2 Previously Treated NSCLC with Exon 20 Insertion Mutations-CHRYSALIS\nThe efficacy of RYBREVANT was evaluated in patients with locally advanced or metastatic\nNSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations in a multicenter, open-label, multi-cohort\nclinical trial (CHRYSALIS, NCT02609776). The study included patients with locally\nadvanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease\nhad progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients with untreated brain\nmetastases and patients with a history of ILD requiring treatment with prolonged\nsteroids or other immunosuppressive agents within the last 2 years were not eligible for\nthe study.\nIn the efficacy population, EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation status was determined by\nprospective local testing using tissue (94%) and/or plasma (6%) samples. Of the 81\npatients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations identified by local testing, plasma\nsamples from 78/81 (96%) patients were tested retrospectively using Guardant360\nCDx, identifying 62/78 (79%) samples with an EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation; 16/78\n(21%) samples did not have an EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation identified.\nPatients received RYBREVANT at 1050 mg (for patient baseline body weight < 80 kg) or\n1400 mg (for patient baseline body weight \u226580 kg) once weekly for 4 weeks, then every\n2 weeks thereafter until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy\noutcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation\nCriteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) as evaluated by Blinded Independent Central\nReview (BICR). An additional efficacy outcome measure was duration of response (DOR)\nby BICR.\nThe efficacy population included 81 patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion\n\u00ae\nmutation with measurable disease who were previously treated with platinum-based\nchemotherapy. The median age was 62 (range: 42 to 84) years, 59% were female; 49%\nwere Asian, 37% were White, 2.5% were Black; 74% had baseline body weight <80 kg;\n95% had adenocarcinoma; and 46% had received prior immunotherapy. The median\nnumber of prior therapies was 2 (range: 1 to 7). At baseline, 67% had Eastern\nCooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 1; 53% never smoked; all\npatients had metastatic disease; and 22% had previously treated brain metastases.\nEfficacy results are summarized in Table 14.\nTable 14: Efficacy Results for CHRYSALIS\nPrior Platinum-based\nChemotherapy Treated \n(N=81)\nBased on Kaplan-Meier estimates. \nNE=Not Estimable, CI=confidence interval.\nOverall Response Rate(95%\nCI)\n40% (29%, 51%)\n  Complete response (CR)\n3.7%\n  Partial response (PR)\n36%\nDuration of Response (DOR)\n  Median, months (95% CI),\nmonths\n11.1 (6.9, NE)\n  Patients with DOR \u22656 months\n63%\n16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING\nHow Supplied\nRYBREVANT \n(amivantamab-vmjw) injection is a sterile, preservative-free, colorless to\npale yellow solution for intravenous infusion.

Recurrent CRS occurred in 24% of IMDELLTRA-treated patients\nincluding 18% Grade 1 and 6% Grade 2.\nMost events (43%) of CRS occurred after the first dose with 29% of patients\nexperiencing any grade CRS after the second dose and 9% of patients experiencing CRS\nfollowing the third dose or later. Following the Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 infusions, 16%,\n4.3%, and 2.1% of patients experienced \u2265 Grade 2 CRS, respectively. The median time\nto onset of all grade CRS from most recent dose of IMDELLTRA was 13.5 hours (range:\n1 to 268 hours). The median time to onset of \u2265 Grade 2 CRS from most recent dose of\nIMDELLTRA was 14.6 hours (range: 2 to 566 hours).\nClinical signs and symptoms of CRS included pyrexia, hypotension, fatigue, tachycardia,\nheadache, hypoxia, nausea and vomiting. Potentially life-threatening complications of\nCRS may include cardiac dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, neurologic\ntoxicity, renal and/or hepatic failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).\nAdminister IMDELLTRA following the recommended step-up dosing and administer\nconcomitant medications before and after Cycle 1 IMDELLTRA infusions as described in\nTable 3 to reduce the risk of CRS [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Administer\nIMDELLTRA in an appropriate health care facility equipped to monitor and manage CRS.\nEnsure patients are well hydrated prior to administration of IMDELLTRA.\nClosely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of CRS during treatment with\nIMDELLTRA. At the first sign of CRS, immediately discontinue IMDELLTRA infusion,\nevaluate the patient for hospitalization and institute supportive care based on severity.\nWithhold or permanently discontinue IMDELLTRA based on severity [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.5)]. Counsel patients to seek medical attention should signs if\nsymptoms of CRS occur.\n5.2 Neurologic Toxicity Including ICANS\nIMDELLTRA can cause serious or life-threatening neurologic toxicity, including ICANS.\nIn the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], neurologic toxicity\nincluding ICANS, occurred in 47% of patients who received IMDELLTRA, including 10%\nGrade 3. The most frequent neurologic toxicities were headache (14%), peripheral\nneuropathy (7%), dizziness (7%), insomnia (6%), muscular weakness (3.7%), delirium\n(2.1%), syncope (1.6%) and neurotoxicity (1.1%).\nICANS occurred in 9% of IMDELLTRA-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nRecurrent ICANS occurred in 1.6% of patients. Most patients experienced ICANS\nfollowing cycle 2 day 1 (24%). Following Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15 infusions, 0.5%, 0.5%\nand 3.7% of patients experienced \u2265 Grade 2 ICANS, respectively. The median time to\nonset of ICANS from the first dose of IMDELLTRA was 29.5 days (range: 1 to 154 days).\nICANS can occur several weeks following administration of IMDELLTRA. The median time\nto resolution of ICANS was 33 days (range: 1 to 93 days).\nThe onset of ICANS can be concurrent with CRS, following resolution of CRS, or in the\nabsence of CRS. Clinical signs and symptoms of ICANS may include but are not limited to\nconfusional state, depressed level of consciousness, disorientation, somnolence,\nlethargy, and bradyphrenia.\nPatients receiving IMDELLTRA are at risk of neurologic adverse reactions and ICANS\nresulting in depressed level of consciousness. Advise patients to refrain from driving and\nengaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially\ndangerous machinery, in the event of any neurologic symptoms until they resolve.\nClosely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicity and ICANS\nduring treatment. At the first sign of ICANS, immediately evaluate the patient and\nprovide supportive therapy based on severity. Withhold IMDELLTRA or permanently\ndiscontinue based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\n5.3 Cytopenias\nIMDELLTRA can cause cytopenias including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.\nIn the pooled safety population, [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], decreased neutrophils\noccurred in 12% including 6% Grade 3 or 4 of IMDELLTRA-treated patients. The median\ntime to onset for Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 29.5 days (range: 2 to 213). Decreased\nplatelets occurred in 33% including 3.2% Grade 3 or 4. The median time to onset for\nGrade 3 or 4 decreased platelets was 50 days (range: 3 to 420). Decreased hemoglobin\noccurred in 58% including 5% Grade 3 or 4. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 0.5% of\npatients treated with IMDELLTRA.\nMonitor patients for signs and symptoms of cytopenias. Perform complete blood counts\nprior to treatment with IMDELLTRA, before each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based\non the severity of cytopenias, temporarily withhold, or permanently discontinue\nIMDELLTRA [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\n5.4 Infections\nIMDELLTRA can cause serious infections, including life-threatening and fatal infections.\nIn the pooled safety population, [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], infections including\nopportunistic infections occurred in 41% of patients who received IMDELLTRA. Grade 3\nor 4 infections occurred in 13% of patients. The most frequent infections were COVID-\n19 (9%, majority during the COVID-19 pandemic), urinary tract infection (10%),\npneumonia (9%), respiratory tract infection (3.2%), and candida infection (3.2%).\nMonitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection prior to and during treatment with\nIMDELLTRA and treat as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue\nIMDELLTRA based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\n5.5 Hepatotoxicity\nIMDELLTRA can cause hepatotoxicity.\nIn the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], elevated ALT occurred in\n42% with Grade 3 or 4 ALT elevation occurring in 2.1% of IMDELLTRA-treated patients.\nElevated AST occurred in 44% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 AST elevation occurring in\n3.2%. Elevated bilirubin occurred in 15% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 total bilirubin\nelevations occurred in 1.6% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Liver enzyme\nelevation can occur with or without concurrent CRS. Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin\nprior to treatment with IMDELLTRA, before each dose, and as clinically indicated.\nWithhold IMDELLTRA or permanently discontinue based on severity [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.5)].\n5.6 Hypersensitivity\nIMDELLTRA can cause severe hypersensitivity reactions.\nClinical signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity may include, but are not limited to, rash\nand bronchospasm. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity during\ntreatment with IMDELLTRA and manage as clinically indicated. Withhold or consider\npermanent discontinuation of IMDELLTRA based on severity [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.5)].\n5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on its mechanism of action, IMDELLTRA may cause fetal harm when administered\nto a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of\nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMDELLTRA\nand for 2 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the\nlabeling:\nCytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nNeurologic Toxicity Including ICANS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nCytopenias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\nInfections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]\nHepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]\nHypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nExtensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer\nThe pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and below\nreflects exposure to intravenous IMDELLTRA, as a single agent, at the recommended\ndosage of IMDELLTRA 1 mg on Cycle 1 Day 1 followed by 10 mg on Days 8 and 15, and\nthen every 2 weeks until disease progression or intolerable toxicity in 187 patients with\nextensive stage small cell lung cancer enrolled in Study DeLLphi-300 and Study DeLLphi-\n301. Among 187 patients who received IMDELLTRA, 31% were exposed for 6 months or\nlonger and 14% were exposed for greater than one year.\nThe most common (>20%) adverse reactions were cytokine release syndrome (55%),\nfatigue (51%), pyrexia (36%), dysgeusia (36%), decreased appetite (34%),\nmusculoskeletal pain (30%), constipation (30%), anemia (27%) and nausea (22%). The\nmost common (\u22652%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased\nlymphocytes (57%), decreased sodium (16%), increased uric acid (10%), decreased\ntotal neutrophils (6%), decreased hemoglobin (5%), increased activated partial\nthromboplastin time (5%), decreased potassium (5%), increased aspartate\naminotransferase (3.2%), decreased white blood cells (3.8%), decreased platelets (3.2%)\nand increased alanine aminotransferase (2.1%).\nThe demographic characteristics of patients who received IMDELLTRA were: median age\n66 years (range: 35 to 82); 65% male; 70% White, 26% Asian, 2.1% Black or African\nAmerican; and 2.1% Hispanic or Latino.\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 58% of patients who received IMDELLTRA.\nSerious adverse reactions in >3% of patients included cytokine release syndrome (24%),\npneumonia (6%), pyrexia (3.7%) and hyponatremia (3.6%). Fatal adverse reactions\noccurred in 2.7% of patients who received IMDELLTRA including pneumonia 0.5%,\naspiration (0.5%), pulmonary embolism (0.5%), respiratory acidosis (0.5%), and\nrespiratory failure (0.5%).\nPermanent discontinuation of IMDELLTRA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 7% of\npatients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of IMDELLTRA\nin >1% of patients included cytokine release syndrome (1.6%) and tumor lysis\nsyndrome (1.1%).\nDosage interruptions of IMDELLTRA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 27% of\npatients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in \u22652% of patients\nincluded fatigue (3.2%), cytokine release syndrome (2 .7%) and respiratory tract\ninfection (2.1%).\nTable 13 summarizes adverse reactions observed in Study DeLLphi-300 and Study\nDeLLphi-301.\nTable 13.

There are no available data on\nthe use of IMDELLTRA in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk.\nIn an animal reproduction study, a murine surrogate molecule administered\nintravenously to pregnant mice crossed the placental barrier.\nTarlatamab-dlle causes T-cell activation and cytokine release; immune activation may\ncompromise pregnancy maintenance.\nHuman immunoglobulin G (IgG) and proteins comprising IgG-derived fragment\ncrystallizable (Fc) domains are known to cross the placental barrier; therefore,\nIMDELLTRA has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus.\nAdvise women of the potential risk to the fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with tarlatamab-dlle. In an\nembryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, a murine surrogate molecule was\nadministered intravenously to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis. The\nsurrogate molecule crossed the placental barrier and did not cause maternal toxicity,\nembryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of tarlatamab-dlle in human milk or the effects on the\nbreastfed child or on milk production. Maternal IgG is known to be present in human\nmilk. The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure in the\nbreastfed child to IMDELLTRA are unknown. Because of the potential for serious\nadverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise patients not to breastfeed during\ntreatment with IMDELLTRA and for 2 months after the last dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nIMDELLTRA may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.1)].\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating\nIMDELLTRA.\nContraception\nFemales\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment\nwith IMDELLTRA and for 2 months after the last dose.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of IMDELLTRA have not been established in pediatric\npatients.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the 187 patients with SCLC who received IMDELLTRA 10 mg as a single agent, 54%\nwere 65 years of age or older and 12% were 75 years of age or older. No overall\ndifferences in IMDELLTRA pharmacokinetics, or safety were observed between older\npatients (\u2265 65 years of age) and younger patients. Clinical studies of IMDELLTRA did not\ninclude sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they\nrespond differently from younger patients.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nTarlatamab-dlle is a bispecific DLL3-directed CD3 T-cell engager that binds to DLL3\nexpressed on the surface of cells, including tumor cells, and CD3 expressed on the\nsurface of T cells. Tarlatamab-dlle is produced using recombinant DNA technology in\nChinese hamster ovary cells.

Tarlatamab-dlle had anti-tumor activity in mouse models of SCLC.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nExposure-Response Relationships\nThere are no clinically significant exposure-response relationships for efficacy over the\nexposure range observed between tarlatamab-dlle 10 mg and 100 mg (10 times the\nhighest approved recommended dosage).\nThere is an exposure-response relationship between tarlatamab-dlle exposure and\nneutropenia or neurologic toxicity including ICANS with a higher risk of any grade\nneutropenia or neurologic toxicity including ICANS at higher exposure.\nSerum Cytokines\nTransient elevation of serum cytokines IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IFN-\u03b3 were observed at\na tarlatamab-dlle dosage of 0.3 mg and above. Peak elevation of cytokines was generally\nobserved 24 hours following the initial dose of IMDELLTRA at 1 mg on Cycle 1 Day 1 and\ngenerally returned to baseline levels prior to the next infusion on Cycle 1 Day 8.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nTarlatamab-dlle pharmacokinetic parameters are presented as geometric mean (CV%)\nunless otherwise specified. The exposure of tarlatamab-dlle increased dose\nproportionally in the evaluated dose range of IMDELLTRA 1 mg to 100 mg every 2 weeks\n(10 times the highest approved recommended dosage). Tarlatamab-dlle steady state\nexposures were achieved by Cycle 2 Day 15. Pharmacokinetic exposures are\nsummarized for the recommended dosage of IMDELLTRA in Table 15.\nTable 15.

Differences in assay methods preclude\nmeaningful comparisons of the incidence of ADA in the studies described below with the\nincidence of ADA in other studies, including those of tarlatamab-dlle or of other\ntarlatamab products.\nIn Study DeLLphi-301, of the patients who received recommended step-up and full\ndosage of IMDELLTRA and were evaluable for presence of ADA against tarlatamab-dlle,\n3.2% (4/124) of patients tested positive for anti-tarlatamab-dlle antibodies and none of\nthe patients developed neutralizing antibodies against tarlatamab-dlle based on a cell-\nbased bioassay. Because of the low occurrence of ADA, the effect of these antibodies\non the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and effectiveness of tarlatamab-\ndlle is unknown.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nNo carcinogenicity or genotoxicity studies have been conducted with tarlatamab-dlle.\nNo studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of tarlatamab-dlle on fertility.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 Small Cell Lung Cancer\nThe efficacy of IMDELLTRA was evaluated in Study DeLLphi-301 [NCT05060016], an\nopen-label, multicenter, multi-cohort clinical trial. Eligible patients were required to have\nrelapsed/refractory SCLC with disease progression after receiving previous treatment\nwith platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other line of prior therapy, an ECOG\nPerformance Status of 0 or 1, and at least one measurable lesion as defined by\nResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) The trial excluded patients\nwith symptomatic brain metastases, evidence of interstitial lung disease or non-\ninfectious pneumonitis, and active immunodeficiency.\nA total of 99 patients received IMDELLTRA intravenously at an initial dose of 1 mg on\nCycle 1 Day 1 followed by 10 mg on Days 8, 15, and every 2 weeks thereafter until\ndisease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\nThe study population characteristics were: median age 64 years (range: 35 to 82); 48%\nof patients \u226565 years and 10% of patients \u226575 years; 72% male; 58% White, 41%\nAsian; 1% Hispanic or Latino; and 74% have ECOG 1.\nNinety-seven percent of patients had metastatic disease at baseline; 22% had brain\nmetastases at baseline; and 92% were former/current smokers. All patients received\nprior platinum-based chemotherapy (median two lines); 74% received prior anti-PD-(L)1\ntherapy (including 59% who received anti-PD[L]1 therapy in combination with platinum-\nbased chemotherapy in the frontline setting); 51% received prior topoisomerase I\ninhibitor (including 20% who received topotecan). Platinum sensitivity status, defined by\ntime to progression after first line platinum therapy, was known for 69/99 patients.\nTwenty-seven patients (27%) had platinum-resistant SCLC, defined as time to\nprogression < 90 days after first line platinum therapy, while 42 patients (42%) had\nplatinum-sensitive SCLC.\nTumor assessments were performed every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks and every 12\nweeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate\n(ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as evaluated by Blinded Independent Central\nReview (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1.\nEfficacy results are presented in Table 16.\nTable 16.

Immune-mediated\nadverse reactions listed herein may not be inclusive of all possible severe and fatal\nVisually inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.\nDiscard vial if solution is cloudy, there is pronounced discoloration (solution may\nhave pale-yellow color), or there is foreign particulate matter other than\ntranslucent-to-white, amorphous particles.\nAllow the vial(s) to stand at room temperature for approximately 5 minutes prior to\npreparation of infusion.\nWithdraw the required volume of YERVOY and transfer into an intravenous bag.\nDilute with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP to a\nfinal concentration ranging from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL. Mix diluted solution by\ngentle inversion.\nAfter preparation, store the diluted solution either refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F\nto 46\u00b0F) or at room temperature of 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F) for no more than\n24 hours from the time of preparation to the time of infusion.\nDiscard partially used or empty vials of YERVOY.\nDo not co-administer other drugs through the same intravenous line.\nFlush the intravenous line with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose\nInjection, USP after each dose.\nAdminister diluted solution through an intravenous line containing a sterile, non-\npyrogenic, low-protein-binding in-line filter.\nWhen administered in combination with nivolumab, infuse nivolumab first followed\nby YERVOY on the same day. When administered with nivolumab and platinum-\ndoublet chemotherapy, infuse nivolumab first followed by YERVOY and then\nplatinum-doublet chemotherapy on the same day. Use separate infusion bags and\nfilters for each infusion.\nimmune-mediated reactions.\nImmune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any\norgan system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time\nafter starting YERVOY. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest\nduring treatment, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after\ndiscontinuation of YERVOY.\nEarly identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of YERVOY.\nMonitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying\nimmune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver\nenzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at\nbaseline and before each dose. Institute medical management promptly, including\nspecialty consultation as appropriate.\nWithhold or permanently discontinue YERVOY depending on severity [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3)]. In general, if YERVOY requires interruption or discontinuation,\nadminister systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent)\nuntil improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate\ncorticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider\nadministration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-\nmediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.\nImmune-Mediated Colitis\nYERVOY can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may be fatal. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)\ninfection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory\nimmune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating\ninfectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies.\nYERVOY 3 mg/kg as a Single Agent\nImmune-mediated colitis occurred in 12% (62/511) of patients who received YERVOY 3\nmg/kg as a single agent, including Grade 3-5 (7%) and Grade 2 (5%).

Systemic corticosteroids were required in 17% (7/42) of patients.\nHyperthyroidism resolved in 91% of the 42 patients. Of the 11 patients in whom YERVOY\nwith nivolumab was withheld for hyperthyroidism, 8 reinitiated treatment after symptom\nimprovement, and 1 had recurrence of hyperthyroidism.\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis\nYERVOY 1 mg/kg with 3 mg/kg Nivolumab\nImmune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.9% (26/666) of patients who received\nYERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of RCC or mCRC, including Grade 3\n(1.4%) and Grade 2 (2.6%). Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY\nand nivolumab in 1.8% and withholding of YERVOY and nivolumab in 1.5% of patients.\nIn patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab, use of systemic\ncorticosteroids was one of the diagnostic criteria required to identify immune-mediated\npneumonitis. Systemic corticosteroids were therefore required in 100% (26/26) of\npatients with immune-mediated pneumonitis. Approximately 8% required\ncoadministration of another immunosuppressant with corticosteroids. Pneumonitis\nresolved in 92% of the 26 patients. Of the 10 patients in whom YERVOY or nivolumab\nwas withheld for pneumonitis, 10 received additional treatment after symptom\nimprovement; of these, 4 had recurrence of pneumonitis.\nIn NSCLC, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 9% (50/576) of patients receiving\nYERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, including Grade\n4 (0.5%), Grade 3 (3.5%), and Grade 2 (4.0%) immune-mediated pneumonitis. Four\npatients (0.7%) died due to pneumonitis. The median duration was 1.5 months (range: 5\ndays to 25+ months). Immune-mediated pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation\nof YERVOY with nivolumab in 5% of patients and withholding of YERVOY with nivolumab\nin 3.6% of patients.\nSystemic corticosteroids were required in 100% of patients with pneumonitis followed by\na corticosteroid taper. Pneumonitis resolved in 72% of the patients. Approximately 13%\n(2/16) of patients had recurrence of pneumonitis after re-initiation of YERVOY with\nnivolumab.\nYERVOY 3 mg/kg with 1 mg/kg Nivolumab\nImmune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 7% (31/456) of patients who received\nYERVOY 3 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of HCC or melanoma, including Grade\n4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (2.0%), and Grade 2 (4.4%). Immune-mediated pneumonitis led to\npermanent discontinuation or withholding of treatment in 2.9% and 3.9% of patients,\nrespectively.\nSystemic corticosteroids were required in 100% of patients with pneumonitis.\nPneumonitis resolved in 94% of the patients. Of the 13 patients in whom YERVOY or\nnivolumab was withheld for pneumonitis, 13 received additional treatment after\nsymptom improvement, and 4 had recurrence of pneumonitis.\nImmune-Mediated Nephritis with Renal Dysfunction\nYERVOY 1 mg/kg with 3 mg/kg Nivolumab\nImmune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction occurred in 4.1% (27/666) of patients\nwho received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of RCC or mCRC,\nincluding Grade 4 (0.6%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (2.2%). Nephritis with renal\ndysfunction led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY and nivolumab in 1.2% and\nwithholding of nivolumab and YERVOY in 1.8% of patients.\nIn patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab, use of systemic\ncorticosteroids was one of the diagnostic criteria required to identify immune-mediated\nnephritis with renal dysfunction. Systemic corticosteroids were therefore required in\n100% (27/27) of patients with immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction.\nNephritis with renal dysfunction resolved in 67% of the 27 patients. Of the 12 patients in\nwhom YERVOY or nivolumab was withheld for nephritis, 10 received additional treatment\nafter symptom improvement; of these, 4 had recurrence of nephritis.\nOther Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions\nAcross clinical trials of YERVOY administered as a single agent or in combination with\nnivolumab, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some\nwith fatal outcome, occurred in <1% of patients unless otherwise specified, as shown\nbelow:\nNervous System: Autoimmune neuropathy (2%), meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and\ndemyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, nerve\nparesis, motor dysfunction\nCardiovascular: Angiopathy, myocarditis, pericarditis, temporal arteritis, vasculitis\nOcular: Blepharitis, episcleritis, iritis, orbital myositis, scleritis, uveitis. Some cases can be\nassociated with retinal detachment. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-\nmediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has\nbeen observed in patients receiving YERVOY and may require treatment with systemic\ncorticosteroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.\nGastrointestinal: Duodenitis, gastritis, pancreatitis (1.3%)\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Arthritis, myositis, polymyalgia rheumatica,\npolymyositis, rhabdomyolysis\nOther (hematologic/immune): Aplastic anemia, conjunctivitis, cytopenias (2.5%),\neosinophilia (2.1%), erythema multiforme, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi\nlymphadenitis), hypersensitivity vasculitis, meningitis, neurosensory hypoacusis,\npsoriasis, sarcoidosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and solid organ\ntransplant rejection.\n5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions\nSevere infusion-related reactions can occur with YERVOY. Discontinue YERVOY in\npatients with severe or life-threatening infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of\ninfusion in patients with mild or moderate infusion reactions [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3)]. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.9% (28/982) of patients\nwho received single-agent YERVOY 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg for the treatment of melanoma.\nInfusion-related reactions occurred in 5% (33/666) of patients who received YERVOY 1\nmg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of RCC or CRC. Infusion-related reactions\noccurred in 8% (4/49) of patients who received YERVOY 3 mg/kg with nivolumab for the\ntreatment of HCC. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 12% (37/300) of patients with\nmalignant pleural mesothelioma who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks with\nnivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks.\n5.3 Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant after\nYERVOY\nFatal or serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) can occur in patients who receive\nYERVOY either before or after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).\nThese complications may occur despite intervening therapy between CTLA-4 receptor\nblocking antibody and allogeneic HSCT.\nFollow patients closely for evidence of GVHD and intervene promptly [see Adverse\nReactions (6.3)]. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with YERVOY after\nallogeneic HSCT.\n5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, YERVOY can cause\nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies,\nadministration of ipilimumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis\nthrough delivery resulted in higher incidences of abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery\n(with corresponding lower birth weight) and higher incidences of infant mortality in a\ndose-related manner. The effects of ipilimumab are likely to be greater during the second\nand third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a\nfetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during\ntreatment with YERVOY and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific\nPopulations (8.1, 8.3)].\n5.5 Risks Associated When Administered in Combination with Nivolumab\nYERVOY is indicated for use in combination with nivolumab for patients with advanced\nRCC, MSI-H or dMMR mCRC, HCC, and NSCLC. Refer to the nivolumab Full Prescribing\nInformation for additional risk information that applies to the combination use treatment.\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the\nlabeling:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in\nthe clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical\npractice.\nThe data described in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to YERVOY\n3 mg/kg as a single agent (or in combination with an investigational gp100 peptide\nvaccine) in 511 patients in Study MDX010-20; YERVOY 10 mg/kg as a single agent in 471\npatients in Study CA184-029; YERVOY 1 mg/kg administered with nivolumab 3 mg/kg in\n1,362 patients in CHECKMATE-214, CHECKMATE-142, CHECKMATE-227, and\nCHECKMATE-743; YERVOY 3 mg/kg administered with nivolumab 1 mg/kg in 456 patients\nenrolled in CHECKMATE-067, CHECKMATE-040, and another randomized trial; and to\nYERVOY 1 mg/kg, administered in combination with nivolumab and platinum-doublet\nSevere and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions [see Warnings and\nPrecautions (5.1)].\nInfusion-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].\nchemotherapy in CHECKMATE-9LA.\nUnresectable or Metastatic Melanoma\nThe safety of YERVOY was evaluated in 643 previously treated patients with\nunresectable or metastatic melanoma in Study MDX010-20 [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].\nStudy MDX010-20 excluded patients with active autoimmune disease or those receiving\nsystemic immunosuppression for organ transplantation. Patients received YERVOY 3\nmg/kg by intravenous infusion for 4 doses as a single agent (n=131), YERVOY with an\ninvestigational gp100 peptide vaccine (n=380), or gp100 peptide vaccine as a single\nagent (n=132). Patients in the trial received a median of 4 doses (range: 1 to 4 doses).\nThe trial population characteristics were: median age 57 years (range: 19 to 90), 59%\nmale, 94% White, and baseline ECOG performance status 0 (56%).\nYERVOY was discontinued for adverse reactions in 10% of patients.

The detection of\nantibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.\nAdditionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody)\npositivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology,\nsample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying\ndisease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies\ndescribed below with the incidences of antibodies to other studies or to other products\nmay be misleading.\nEleven (1.1%) of 1024 evaluable patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma\ntested positive for treatment-emergent binding antibodies against ipilimumab in an\nelectrochemiluminescent (ECL) based assay. This assay had substantial limitations in\ndetecting anti-ipilimumab antibodies in the presence of ipilimumab. Seven (4.9%) of 144\npatients receiving ipilimumab developed anti-ipilimumab antibodies and 7 (4.5%) of 156\npatients receiving placebo for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma tested positive for\nanti-ipilimumab antibodies using an ECL assay with improved drug tolerance. No patients\ntested positive for neutralizing antibodies. No infusion-related reactions occurred in\npatients who tested positive for anti-ipilimumab antibodies.\nOf the 499 patients evaluable for anti-ipilimumab antibodies in CHECKMATE-214 and\na\nCHECKMATE-142, 27 (5.4%) were positive for anti-ipilimumab antibodies; there were no\npatients with neutralizing antibodies against ipilimumab. There was no evidence of\nincreased incidence of infusion reactions to YERVOY in patients with anti-ipilimumab\nantibodies.\nOf 483 patients evaluable for anti-ipilimumab antibodies in CHECKMATE-227 Part 1, 8.5%\nwere positive for treatment-emergent anti-ipilimumab antibodies. No patients had\nneutralizing antibodies against ipilimumab. In Part 1 of the same study, of 491 patients\nevaluable for anti-nivolumab antibodies, 36.7% were positive for anti-nivolumab\nantibodies and 1.4% had neutralizing antibodies against nivolumab.\nOf 305 patients evaluable for anti-ipilimumab antibodies in CHECKMATE-9LA, 8% were\npositive for anti-ipilimumab antibodies and 1.6% were positive for anti-ipilimumab\nneutralizing antibodies. There was no evidence of increased incidence of infusion\nreactions to YERVOY in patients with anti-ipilimumab antibodies. Of 308 patients\nevaluable for anti-nivolumab antibodies in CHECKMATE-9LA, 34% were positive for anti-\nnivolumab antibodies and 2.6% had neutralizing antibodies against nivolumab.\nOf 271 patients evaluable for anti-ipilimumab antibodies in CHECKMATE-743, 13.7% were\npositive for anti-ipilimumab antibodies and 0.4% were positive for anti-ipilimumab\nneutralizing antibodies. Of 269 patients evaluable for anti-nivolumab antibodies in\nCHECKMATE-743, 25.7% were positive for anti-nivolumab antibodies and 0.7% had\nneutralizing antibodies against nivolumab.\n6.3 Postmarketing Experience\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of\nYERVOY. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of\nuncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a\ncausal relationship to drug exposure.\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders: hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)\nImmune System: graft-versus-host disease, solid organ transplant rejection\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms\n(DRESS syndrome)\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.1)], YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant\nwoman. There is insufficient human data for YERVOY exposure in pregnant women. In\nanimal reproduction studies, administration of ipilimumab to cynomolgus monkeys from\nthe onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in higher incidences of abortion,\nstillbirth, premature delivery (with corresponding lower birth weight), and higher\nincidences of infant mortality in a dose-related manner (see Data). The effects of\nipilimumab are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.\nHuman IgG1 is known to cross the placental barrier and ipilimumab is an IgG1;\ntherefore, ipilimumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the\ndeveloping fetus. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Report\npregnancies to Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-844-593-7869.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nIn a combined study of embryo-fetal and peri-postnatal development, pregnant\ncynomolgus monkeys received ipilimumab every 3 weeks from the onset of\norganogenesis in the first trimester through parturition. No treatment-related adverse\neffects on reproduction were detected during the first two trimesters of pregnancy.\nBeginning in the third trimester, administration of ipilimumab at doses resulting in\nexposures approximately 2.6 to 7.2 times the human exposure at a dose of 3 mg/kg\nresulted in dose-related increases in abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery (with\ncorresponding lower birth weight), and an increased incidence of infant mortality. In\naddition, developmental abnormalities were identified in the urogenital system of 2 infant\nmonkeys exposed in utero to 30 mg/kg of ipilimumab (7.2 times the humans exposure\nbased on area under the curve at a dose of 3 mg/kg). One female infant monkey had\nunilateral renal agenesis of the left kidney and ureter, and 1 male infant monkey had an\nimperforate urethra with associated urinary obstruction and subcutaneous scrotal\nedema.\nGenetically engineered mice heterozygous for CTLA-4 (CTLA-4+/\u2212), the target for\nipilimumab, appeared healthy and gave birth to healthy CTLA-4+/\u2212 heterozygous\noffspring. Mated CTLA-4+/\u2212 heterozygous mice also produced offspring deficient in\nCTLA-4 (homozygous negative, CTLA-4\u2212/\u2212). The CTLA-4\u2212/\u2212 homozygous negative\noffspring appeared healthy at birth, exhibited signs of multiorgan lymphoproliferative\ndisease by 2 weeks of age, and all died by 3 to 4 weeks of age with massive\nlymphoproliferation and multiorgan tissue destruction.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of YERVOY in human milk or its effects on the\nbreastfed child or milk production. In monkeys, ipilimumab was present in milk (see\nData). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children,\nadvise women not to breastfeed during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months\nfollowing the last dose.\nData\nIn monkeys treated at dose levels resulting in exposures 2.6 and 7.2 times higher than\nthose in humans at a 3 mg/kg dose, ipilimumab was present in milk at concentrations of\n0.1 mcg/mL and 0.4 mcg/mL, representing a ratio of up to 0.3% of the steady-state\nserum concentration of the drug.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating YERVOY\n[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nContraception\nYERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective\ncontraception during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months following the last dose.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of YERVOY have been established in pediatric patients aged\n12 years and older for the following indications: as a single agent and in combination\nwith nivolumab for unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and, in combination with\nnivolumab for MSI-H or dMMR mCRC that has progressed following treatment with a\nfluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Use of YERVOY for these indications is\nsupported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with\nmelanoma or MSI-H or dMMR mCRC and additional pharmacokinetic data in pediatric\npatients. Ipilimumab exposures in pediatric patients 12 years and older are comparable\nto that of adults, and the courses of melanoma and MSI-H or dMMR mCRC are similar in\npediatric patients aged 12 years and older to that of adults to allow extrapolation of\nsafety and efficacy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical\nStudies (14.4)].\nThe safety and effectiveness of YERVOY have not been established in pediatric patients\nyounger than 12 years old with unresectable or metastatic melanoma or MSI-H or dMMR\nmCRC.\nThe safety and effectiveness of YERVOY have not been established in pediatric patients\nfor the adjuvant treatment of melanoma or for the treatment of advanced renal cell\ncarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, malignant\npleural mesothelioma and esophageal cancer.\nIn a dose-finding trial (NCT01445379), 33 patients aged 2 to 21 years (median 13 years)\nwith relapsed or refractory solid tumors were evaluated including unresectable stage IIIc\nor stage IV melanoma (12), progressive or refractory sarcomas (17), renal or bladder\ncarcinoma (3), and neuroblastoma (1). No responses in the patients with non-melanoma\nsolid tumors and no new safety signals were observed in pediatric patients in this study.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nSingle Agent\nOf the 511 patients treated with YERVOY in Study MDX010-20 (unresectable or\nmetastatic melanoma), 28% were 65 years and over. No overall differences in safety or\neffectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients.\nIn Combination with Nivolumab\nOf the 314 patients randomized to YERVOY administered with nivolumab in CHECKMATE-\n067, 41% were 65 years or older and 11% were 75 years or older. No overall\ndifferences in safety or effectiveness were reported between elderly patients and\nyounger patients.\nOf the 576 patients randomized to YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks with nivolumab 3\nmg/kg every 2 weeks in CHECKMATE-227 (NSCLC), 48% were 65 years or older and\n10% were 75 years or older. No overall difference in safety was reported between older\npatients and younger patients; however, there was a higher discontinuation rate due to\nadverse reactions in patients aged 75 years or older (29%) relative to all patients who\nreceived YERVOY with nivolumab (18%). Of the 396 patients in the primary efficacy\npopulation (PD-L1 \u22651%) randomized to YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks with nivolumab\n3 mg/kg every 2 weeks in CHECKMATE-227, the hazard ratio for overall survival was\n0.70 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.89) in the 199 patients younger than 65 years compared to 0.91\n(95% CI: 0.72, 1.15) in the 197 patients 65 years or older [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].\nOf the 303 patients randomized to YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks in combination with\nnivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks in CHECKMATE-743 (malignant pleural mesothelioma),\n77% were 65 years old or older and 26% were 75 years or older. No overall difference in\nsafety was reported between older patients and younger patients; however, there were\nhigher rates of serious adverse reactions and discontinuation rate due to adverse\nreactions in patients aged 75 years or older (68% and 35%, respectively) relative to all\npatients who received YERVOY with nivolumab (54% and 28%, respectively). For patients\naged 75 years or older who received chemotherapy, the rate of serious adverse\nreactions was 34% and discontinuation due to adverse reactions was 26% relative to\n28% and 19% respectively for all patients. The hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.76\n(95% CI: 0.52, 1.11) in the 71 patients younger than 65 years compared to 0.74 (95%\nCI: 0.59, 0.93) in the 232 patients 65 years or older randomized to YERVOY in\ncombination with nivolumab.\nOf the 550 patients randomized to YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab in CHECKMATE-214\n(renal cell carcinoma), 38% were 65 years or older and 8% were 75 years or older. No\noverall difference in safety was observed between these patients and younger patients.\nIn geriatric patients with intermediate or poor risk, no overall difference in effectiveness\nwas observed.\nOf the 49 patients who received YERVOY 3 mg/kg with nivolumab in Cohort 4 of\nCHECKMATE-040 (hepatocellular carcinoma), 29% were between 65 years and 74 years\nof age and 8% were 75 years or older. Clinical studies of YERVOY in combination with\nnivolumab did not include sufficient numbers of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma\naged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.\nOf the 325 patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks in combination with\nnivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks in CHECKMATE-648 (ESCC), 43% were 65 years old or\nolder and 7% were 75 years or older. No overall difference in safety was reported\nbetween older patients and younger patients; however, there was a higher\ndiscontinuation rate due to adverse reactions in patients aged 75 years or older (38%)\nrelative to all patients who received YERVOY with nivolumab (23%). For patients aged 75\nyears or older who received chemotherapy, the discontinuation rate due to adverse\nreactions was 33% relative to 23% for all patients.\nStudy CA184-029 (adjuvant treatment of melanoma) and CHECKMATE-142 (metastatic\ncolorectal cancer) did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older\nto determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.\nIn Combination with Nivolumab and Platinum-Doublet Chemotherapy\nOf the 361 patients randomized to YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks in combination with\nnivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks and platinum-doublet chemotherapy every 3 weeks\n(for 2 cycles) in CHECKMATE-9LA (NSCLC), 51% were 65 years or older and 10% were\n75 years or older. No overall difference in safety was reported between older patients\nand younger patients; however, there was a higher discontinuation rate due to adverse\nreactions in patients aged 75 years or older (43%) relative to all patients who received\nYERVOY with nivolumab and chemotherapy (24%). For patients aged 75 years or older\nwho received chemotherapy only, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was\n16% relative to all patients who had a discontinuation rate of 13%. Based on an updated\nanalysis for overall survival, of the 361 patients randomized to YERVOY in combination\nwith nivolumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy in CHECKMATE-9LA, the hazard\nratio for overall survival was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.80) in the 176 patients younger than\n65 years compared to 0.73 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.95) in the 185 patients 65 years or older.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nIpilimumab is a human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4)-blocking antibody.\nIpilimumab is a recombinant IgG1 kappa immunoglobulin with an approximate molecular\nweight of 148 kDa. Ipilimumab is produced in mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cell\nculture.\nYERVOY (ipilimumab) injection, for intravenous use is a sterile, preservative-free, clear to\nslightly opalescent, colorless to pale-yellow solution, which may contain a small amount\nof visible translucent-to-white, amorphous ipilimumab particulates. It is supplied in single-\ndose vials of 50 mg/10 mL or 200 mg/40 mL. Each milliliter contains 5 mg of ipilimumab\nand the following inactive ingredients: diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) (0.04\nmg), mannitol (10 mg), polysorbate 80 (vegetable origin) (0.1 mg), sodium chloride (5.85\nmg), tris hydrochloride (3.15 mg), and Water for Injection, USP at a pH of 7.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nCTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that\nbinds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86.\nBlockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation,\nincluding the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of\nCTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a\ngeneral increase in T cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics (PK) of ipilimumab was studied in 785 patients with unresectable\nor metastatic melanoma who received doses of 0.3, 3, or 10 mg/kg once every 3 weeks\nfor 4 doses. The PK of ipilimumab is linear in the dose range of 0.3 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg.\nFollowing administration of YERVOY every 3 weeks, the systemic accumulation was 1.5-\nfold or less. Steady-state concentrations of ipilimumab were reached by the third dose;\nthe mean minimum concentration (C\n) at steady state was 19.4 mcg/mL at 3 mg/kg\nand 58.1 mcg/mL at 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks.\nmin\nElimination\nThe mean (percent coefficient of variation) terminal half-life (t\n) was 15.4 days (34%)\nand then mean (percent coefficient of variation) clearance (CL) was 16.8 mL/h (38%).\nThe CL of ipilimumab was unchanged in presence of anti-ipilimumab antibodies.\nSpecific Populations\nThe CL of ipilimumab increased with increasing body weight supporting the\nrecommended body weight (mg/kg) based dosing. The following factors had no clinically\nimportant effect on the CL of ipilimumab: age (range: 23 to 88 years), sex, performance\nstatus, renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \u226515 mL/min/1.73 m ), mild hepatic\nimpairment (total bilirubin [TB] >1 to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] or AST >\nULN), previous cancer therapy, and baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The\neffect of race was not examined due to limited data available in non-White racial groups.\nYERVOY has not been studied in patients with moderate (TB > 1.5 to 3 times ULN and\nany AST) or severe (TB >3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment.\nPediatric Patients\nThe exposures of ipilimumab in pediatric patients 12 years and older are comparable to\nthose in adult patients at the recommended dosage.\nDrug Interaction Studies\nIpilimumab with Nivolumab\nWhen YERVOY 1 mg/kg was administered with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, the CL\nof ipilimumab was unchanged compared to when YERVOY was administered alone.\nWhen YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks was administered in combination with nivolumab\n1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, the CL of ipilimumab was unchanged compared to ipilimumab\nadministered alone and the CL of nivolumab was increased by 29% compared to\nnivolumab administered alone.\nWhen YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks was administered in combination with nivolumab\n3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, the CL of ipilimumab increased by 30% compared to YERVOY\nadministered alone and the CL of nivolumab was unchanged compared to nivolumab\nadministered alone.\nWhen YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks was administered in combination with nivolumab\n360 mg every 3 weeks and chemotherapy, the CL of ipilimumab increased by 22%\ncompared to YERVOY administered alone and the CL of nivolumab was unchanged\ncompared to nivolumab administered alone.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nThe carcinogenic potential of ipilimumab has not been evaluated in long-term animal\nstudies, and the genotoxic potential of ipilimumab has not been evaluated.\nFertility studies have not been performed with ipilimumab.\n1/2\n2\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma\nThe efficacy of YERVOY were investigated in a Study MDX010-20, a randomized (3:1:1),\ndouble-blind, double-dummy trial (NCT00094653) that included patients with\nunresectable or metastatic melanoma previously treated with one or more of the\nfollowing: aldesleukin, dacarbazine, temozolomide, fotemustine, or carboplatin. The trial\nenrolled only patients with HLA-A2*0201 genotype; this HLA genotype facilitates the\nimmune presentation of the investigational peptide vaccine. The trial excluded patients\nwith active autoimmune disease or those receiving systemic immunosuppression for\norgan transplantation. Patients were randomized to YERVOY administered at a dose of 3\nmg/kg as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for 4 doses with an investigational\npeptide vaccine with incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant - gp100 administered at a dose of 2\nmg peptide by deep subcutaneous injection every 3 weeks for 4 doses; gp100\nadministered at a dose of 2 mg by deep subcutaneous injection every 3 weeks for 4\ndoses as a single agent with a placebo; or YERVOY administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg by\nintravenous infusion every 3 weeks for 4 doses with a placebo. The major efficacy\noutcome measure was overall survival (OS) in the YERVOY and gp100 arm compared to\nthat in the single-agent gp100 arm. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were OS in\nthe YERVOY and gp100 arm compared to the YERVOY arm, OS in the YERVOY arm\ncompared to the gp100 arm, best overall response rate (BORR) as assessed by the\ninvestigator at week 24 between each of the trial arms, and duration of response.\nAssessment of tumor response was conducted at weeks 12 and 24, and every 3\nmonths thereafter. Patients with evidence of objective tumor response at 12 or 24\nweeks had assessment for confirmation of durability of response at 16 or 28 weeks,\nrespectively.\nA total of 676 patients were randomized, 403 to YERVOY and gp100 arm, 137 to\nYERVOY single agent arm and 136 to gp100 single agent arm. Of the randomized\npatients, 61%, 59%, and 54% in the YERVOY and gp100, YERVOY, and gp100 arms,\nrespectively, were male. Twenty-nine percent were \u2265 65 years of age, the median age\nwas 57 years, 71% had M1c stage, 12% had a history of previously treated brain\nmetastasis, 98% had ECOG performance status of 0 and 1, 23% had received\naldesleukin, and 38% had elevated LDH level. Sixty-one percent of patients randomized\nto either YERVOY-containing arm received all 4 planned doses. The median duration of\nfollow-up was 8.9 months.\nThe efficacy results are shown in Table 23 and Figure 1.\nTable 23: Efficacy Results for Study MDX010-20\nYERVOY 3\nmg/kg\nn=137\nYERVOY 3\nmg/kg and\ngp100 \nn=403\ngp100 \nn=136\nOverall Survival\nMedian in months (95% CI)\n10 (8.0, 13.8)\n10 (8.5, 11.5)\n6 (5.5, 8.7)\nHazard ratio (vs. gp100) (95%\nCI)\n0.66 (0.51, 0.87) 0.68 (0.55, 0.85)\np-value\np=0.0026\np=0.0004\na\n Not adjusted for multiple comparisons\n Not reached\nHazard ratio (vs. YERVOY) (95%\nCI)\n1.04 (0.83, 1.30)\nBest Overall Response Rate\n(BORR)\n(95% CI)\n10.9%\n(6.3%, 17.4%)\n5.7%\n(3.7%, 8.4%)\n1.5%\n(0.2%, 5.2%)\nMedian duration of response in\nmonths\nNR\n11.5\nNR\nFigure 1: Kaplan Meier Curves for Overall Survival in Study MDX010-20\nPreviously Untreated Metastatic Melanoma: In Combination with Nivolumab\nCHECKMATE-067 (NCT01844505) was a multicenter, randomized (1:1:1), double-blind\ntrial in which 945 patients with previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic\nmelanoma were randomized to one of the following arms: YERVOY and nivolumab,\nnivolumab, or YERVOY. Patients were required to have completed adjuvant or\nneoadjuvant treatment at least 6 weeks prior to randomization and have no prior\ntreatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody and no evidence of active brain metastasis, ocular\nmelanoma, autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic\nimmunosuppression.\nPatients were randomized to receive:\n\u2022\na\nb\nb\nb\nYERVOY 3 mg/kg with nivolumab 1 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses,\nfollowed by nivolumab as a single agent at a dose of 3 mg/kg by intravenous\ninfusion every 2 weeks (YERVOY and nivolumab arm),\n\u2022\n\u2022\nRandomization was stratified by PD-L1 expression (\u22655% vs. <5% tumor cell membrane\nexpression) as determined by a clinical trial assay, BRAF V600 mutation status, and M\nstage per the AJCC staging system (M0, M1a, M1b vs. M1c). Tumor assessments were\nconducted 12 weeks after randomization then every 6 weeks for the first year, and\nevery 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were investigator-\nassessed PFS per RECIST v1.1 and OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures were\nconfirmed ORR and duration of response.\nThe trial population characteristics were: median age 61 years (range: 18 to 90); 65%\nmale; 97% White; ECOG performance score 0 (73%) or 1 (27%). Disease characteristics\nwere: AJCC Stage IV disease (93%); M1c disease (58%); elevated LDH (36%); history of\nbrain metastases (4%); BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma (32%); PD-L1 \u22655%\ntumor cell membrane expression as determined by the clinical trials assay (46%); and\nprior adjuvant therapy (22%).\nCHECKMATE-067 demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS and PFS for\npatients randomized to either nivolumab-containing arm as compared with the YERVOY\narm. The trial was not designed to assess whether adding YERVOY to nivolumab\nimproves PFS or OS compared to nivolumab as a single agent.

Enrollment required\ncomplete resection of melanoma with full lymphadenectomy within 12 weeks prior to\nrandomization. Patients with prior therapy for melanoma, autoimmune disease, and prior\nor concomitant use of immunosuppressive agents were ineligible. Patients were\nrandomized to receive YERVOY 10 mg/kg or placebo as an intravenous infusion every 3\nweeks for 4 doses, followed by YERVOY 10 mg/kg or placebo every 12 weeks from\nWeek 24 to Week 156 (3 years) or until documented disease recurrence or\nunacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by stage according to American Joint\nCommittee on Cancer (AJCC) 2002 classification (Stage IIIA >1 mm nodal involvement,\nStage IIIB, Stage IIIC with 1 to 3 involved lymph nodes, and Stage IIIC with \u22654 involved\nlymph nodes) and by region (North America, Europe, and Australia). The major efficacy\noutcome measures were independent review committee (IRC)-assessed recurrence-free\nsurvival (RFS), defined as the time between the date of randomization and the earliest\ndate of first recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis) or death, and overall\nsurvival. Tumor assessment was conducted every 12 weeks for the first 3 years then\nevery 24 weeks until distant recurrence.\nAmong 951 patients enrolled, 475 were randomized to receive YERVOY and 476 to\nplacebo. Median age was 51 years (range: 18 to 84), 62% were male, 99% were White,\n94% had ECOG performance status of 0. With regard to disease stage, 20% had Stage\nIIIA with lymph nodes >1 mm, 44% had Stage IIIB, and 36% had Stage IIIC (with no in-\ntransit metastases). Other disease characteristics of the trial population were: clinically\npalpable lymph nodes (58%), 2 or more positive lymph nodes (54%), and ulcerated\nprimary lesions (42%).\nThe efficacy results are in Table 25 and Figure 3.\nTable 25: Efficacy Results for Study CA184-029\nYERVOY 10 mg/kg\nn=475\nPlacebo \nn=476\nRecurrence-Free Survival\nNumber of events\n234 (49%)\n294 (62%)\n     Recurrence\n220\n289\n     Death\n14\n5\nMedian in months (95% CI)\n26 (19, 39)\n17 (13, 22)\nHazard ratio (95% CI)\n0.75 (0.64, 0.90)\np-value (stratified log-rank )\np<0.002\nOverall Survival\na\n Stratified by disease stage.\nNumber of deaths\n162 (34%)\n214 (45%)\nHazard ratio (95% CI)\n0.72 (0.58, 0.88)\np-value (stratified log-rank )\np<0.002\nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier Curves for Overall Survival in Study CA184-029\n14.3 Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma\nThe efficacy of YERVOY with nivolumab was evaluated in CHECKMATE-214\n(NCT02231749), a randomized (1:1), open-label study in patients with previously\nuntreated advanced RCC. Patients were included regardless of their PD-L1 status.\nCHECKMATE-214 excluded patients with any history of or concurrent brain metastases,\nactive autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic\nimmunosuppression. Patients were randomized to nivolumab 3 mg/kg and YERVOY 1\nmg/kg administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by nivolumab 3\nmg/kg every two weeks or to sunitinib administered orally 50 mg daily for the first 4\nweeks of each 6-week cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression or\nunacceptable toxicity. Patients were stratified by International Metastatic RCC Database\nConsortium (IMDC) prognostic score and region. The major efficacy outcome measures\na\na\nwere OS, PFS (IRRC-assessed), and confirmed ORR (IRRC-assessed) in\nintermediate/poor risk patients. Intermediate/poor risk patients had at least 1 or more of\n6 prognostic risk factors as per the IMDC criteria: less than one year from time of initial\nRCC diagnosis to randomization, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) <80%,\nhemoglobin less than the lower limit of normal, corrected calcium >10 mg/dL, platelet\ncount > ULN, and absolute neutrophil count > ULN.\nA total of 847 patients were randomized, 425 to YERVOY with nivolumab and 422 to\nsunitinib. The median age was 61 years (range: 21 to 85) with 38% \u226565 years of age\nand 8% \u226575 years of age. The majority of patients were male (73%) and White (87%)\nand 26% and 74% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70% to 80% and 90% to 100%,\nrespectively.\nEfficacy results from CHECKMATE-214 are presented in Table 26 and Figure 4.

Patients with known EGFR mutations or ALK\ntranslocations sensitive to available targeted inhibitor therapy, untreated brain\nmetastases, carcinomatous meningitis, active autoimmune disease, or medical\nconditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded from the study.\nPatients with treated brain metastases were eligible if neurologically returned to baseline\nat least 2 weeks prior to enrolment, and either off corticosteroids, or on a stable or\ndecreasing dose of <10 mg daily prednisone equivalents.\nPrimary efficacy results were based on Part 1a of the study, which was limited to\npatients with PD-L1 tumor expression \u22651%. Tumor specimens were evaluated\nprospectively using the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay at a central laboratory.\nRandomization was stratified by tumor histology (non-squamous versus squamous).\nThe evaluation of efficacy relied on the comparison between:\n\u2022\n\u2022\nChemotherapy regimens consisted of pemetrexed (500 mg/m ) and cisplatin (75\nmg/m ) or pemetrexed (500 mg/m ) and carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6) for non-squamous\nNSCLC or gemcitabine (1000 or 1250 mg/m ) and cisplatin (75 mg/m ) or gemcitabine\n(1000 mg/m ) and carboplatin (AUC 5) (gemcitabine was administered on Days 1 and 8\nof each cycle) for squamous NSCLC.\nStudy treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or for up to\n24 months. Treatment continued beyond disease progression if a patient was clinically\nstable and was considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator.

Median time to first\noccurrence of cuSCC/KA was 5.8 months (range 1 to 9 months) [see Adverse Reactions\n(6.1)].\nFor patients who received BRAFTOVI as a single agent, cuSCC/KA was reported in 8%,\nbasal cell carcinoma in 1%, and a new primary melanoma in 5% of patients.\nIn BEACON CRC, cuSCC/KA occurred in 1.4% of patients with CRC, and a new primary\nmelanoma occurred in 1.4% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with\ncetuximab.\nIn PHAROS, cuSCC and skin papilloma, each occurred in 2% of patients who received\nBRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib.\nPerform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiating treatment, every 2 months during\ntreatment, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of treatment. Manage\nsuspicious skin lesions with excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Dose\nmodification is not recommended for new primary cutaneous malignancies.\nNon-Cutaneous Malignancies\nBased on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI may promote malignancies associated\nwith activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms [see Warnings and\nPrecautions (5.2)]. Monitor patients receiving BRAFTOVI for signs and symptoms of\nnon-cutaneous malignancies. Discontinue BRAFTOVI for RAS mutation-positive non-\ncutaneous malignancies [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\n5.2 Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors\nIn vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP-kinase signaling\nand increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells, which are exposed to BRAF\ninhibitors. Confirm evidence of BRAF V600E or V600K mutation prior to initiating\nBRAFTOVI [see Indications and Usage (1), Dosage and Administration (2.1)].\n5.3 Cardiomyopathy\nCardiomyopathy, manifesting as left ventricular dysfunction associated with\nsymptomatic or asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction, has been reported in\npatients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. In COLUMBUS, evidence\nof cardiomyopathy (decreased in LVEF below the institutional LLN with an absolute\ndecreased in LVEF \u226510% below baseline as detected by echocardiography or MUGA)\noccurred in 7% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI plus binimetinib. Grade 3 left ventricular\ndysfunction occurred in 1.6% of patients. The median time to first occurrence of left\nventricular dysfunction (any grade) in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with\nbinimetinib was 3.6 months (range 0 to 21 months). Cardiomyopathy resolved in 87% of\npatients receiving BRAFTOVI plus binimetinib.\nIn PHAROS, evidence of cardiomyopathy (decrease in LVEF below the institutional LLN\nwith an absolute decrease in LVEF \u226510% below baseline as detected by\nechocardiography or MUGA) occurred in 11% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in\ncombination with binimetinib. Grade 3 left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 1% of\npatients. Cardiomyopathy resolved in 82% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI plus\nbinimetinib.\nAssess ejection fraction by echocardiogram or MUGA scan prior to initiating treatment,\none month after initiating treatment, and every 2 to 3 months during treatment. The\nsafety of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib has not been established in patients\nwith baseline ejection fraction that is either below 50% or below the institutional lower\nlimit of normal (LLN). Patients with cardiovascular risk factors should be monitored\nclosely when treated with BRAFTOVI.\nWithhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse\nreaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n5.4 Hepatotoxicity\nHepatotoxicity can occur when BRAFTOVI is administered in combination with\nbinimetinib. In COLUMBUS, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function\nlaboratory tests in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was 6%\nfor alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 2.6% for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and\n0.5% for alkaline phosphatase. In PHAROS, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in\nliver function laboratory tests in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with\nbinimetinib was 10% for AST, 9% for ALT, and 3.2% for alkaline phosphatase.\nMonitor liver laboratory tests before initiation of BRAFTOVI, monthly during treatment,\nand as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on\nseverity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions\n(6.1)].\n5.5 Hemorrhage\nIn COLUMBUS, hemorrhage occurred in 19% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in\ncombination with binimetinib; Grade 3 or greater hemorrhage occurred in 3.2% of\npatients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were gastrointestinal, including rectal\nhemorrhage (4.2%), hematochezia (3.1%), and hemorrhoidal hemorrhage (1%). Fatal\nintracranial hemorrhage in the setting of new or progressive brain metastases occurred\nin 1.6% of patients.\nIn BEACON CRC, hemorrhage occurred in 19% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in\ncombination with cetuximab; Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage occurred in 1.9% of\npatients, including fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 0.5% of patients. The most\nfrequent hemorrhagic events were epistaxis (6.9%), hematochezia (2.3%), and rectal\nhemorrhage (2.3%).\nIn PHAROS, hemorrhage occurred in 12% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in\ncombination with binimetinib including fatal hemorrhage intracranial (1%); Grade 3 or 4\nhemorrhage occurred in 4.1% of patients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were\nanal hemorrhage and hemothorax (2% each).\nWithhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse\nreaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n5.6 Uveitis\nUveitis, including iritis and iridocyclitis, has been reported in patients treated with\nBRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. In COLUMBUS, the incidence of uveitis among\npatients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was 4%. In PHAROS, the\nincidence of uveitis among patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with\nbinimetinib was 1%.\nAssess for visual symptoms at each visit. Perform an ophthalmologic evaluation at\nregular intervals and for new or worsening visual disturbances, and to follow new or\npersistent ophthalmologic findings. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue\nbased on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Adverse\nReactions (6.1)].\n5.7 QT Prolongation\nBRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation in some patients\n[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In COLUMBUS, an increase in QTcF to >500 ms was\nmeasured in 0.5% (1/192) of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with\nbinimetinib. In PHAROS, an increase in QTcF to >500 ms was measured in 2.1% (2/95)\nof patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib.\nMonitor patients who already have or who are at significant risk of developing QTc\nprolongation, including patients with known long QT syndromes, clinically significant\nbradyarrhythmias, severe or uncontrolled heart failure and those taking other medicinal\nproducts associated with QT prolongation. Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia\nprior to and during BRAFTOVI administration. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently\ndiscontinue for QTc >500 ms [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Adverse Reactions\n(6.1)].\n5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered\nto a pregnant woman. Encorafenib produced embryo-fetal developmental changes in\nrats and rabbits and was an abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to\nthose resulting in exposures approximately 26 (in the rat) and 178 (in the rabbit) times\nthe human exposure at the recommended dose of 450 mg, with no clear findings at\nlower doses.\nAdvise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a\nfetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective, non-hormonal\nmethod of contraception since BRAFTOVI can render hormonal contraceptives\nineffective, during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose of BRAFTOVI [see Use\nin Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].\n5.9 Risks Associated with BRAFTOVI as a Single Agent\nBRAFTOVI when used as a single agent is associated with an increased risk of certain\nadverse reactions compared to when BRAFTOVI is used in combination with binimetinib.\nIn COLUMBUS, Grades 3 or 4 dermatologic reactions occurred in 21% of patients\ntreated with BRAFTOVI single agent compared to 2% of patients treated with BRAFTOVI\nin combination with binimetinib [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions\n(6.1)].\nIf binimetinib is temporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued, reduce the dose of\nBRAFTOVI as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\n5.10 Risks Associated with Combination Treatment\nBRAFTOVI is indicated for use as part of a regimen in combination with binimetinib or\ncetuximab. Refer to the prescribing information for binimetinib and cetuximab for\nadditional risk information.\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nBRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma\nThe safety of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib is described in 192 patients with\nBRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received\nBRAFTOVI (450 mg once daily) in combination with binimetinib (45 mg twice daily) in a\nrandomized open-label, active-controlled trial (COLUMBUS).\nThe COLUMBUS trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] excluded patients with a history of\nGilbert's syndrome, abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, prolonged QTc (>480\nms), uncontrolled hypertension, and history or current evidence of retinal vein\nocclusion.

Avoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with strong or\nmoderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, including grapefruit juice. If coadministration is unavoidable,\nreduce the BRAFTOVI dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].\nStrong CYP3A4 Inducers\nCoadministration of BRAFTOVI with a strong CYP3A4 inducer may decrease encorafenib\nplasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] and may decrease encorafenib\nefficacy. Avoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with strong CYP3A4 inducers.\n7.2 Effect of BRAFTOVI on Other Drugs\nSensitive CYP3A4 Substrates\nBRAFTOVI is a strong CYP3A4 inducer at steady-state. Concomitant use of BRAFTOVI\nmay decrease the plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (including hormonal\ncontraceptives), [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may reduce the efficacy of\nthese substrates. Avoid the coadministration of BRAFTOVI with CYP3A4 substrates for\nwhich a decrease in plasma concentration may lead to reduced efficacy of the substrate.\nIf the coadministration cannot be avoided, see the CYP3A4 substrate product labeling\nfor recommendations.\nOATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BCRP Substrates\nCoadministration of BRAFTOVI with OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BCRP substrates can result\nin increased concentrations of the substrates, and may increase toxicity of these\nagents. When used in combination, monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of\nincreased exposure and consider adjusting the dose of these substrates [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.3)].\n7.3 Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval\nBRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation [see Warnings\nand Precautions (5.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Avoid coadministration of\nBRAFTOVI with drugs known to prolong the QT/QTc interval.\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered\nBased on the number of patients with available baseline and at least one on-treatment laboratory\ntest.\nto a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no available clinical\ndata on the use of BRAFTOVI during pregnancy. In animal reproduction studies,\nencorafenib produced embryo-fetal developmental changes in rats and rabbits and was\nan abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures\napproximately 26 (in the rat) and 178 (in the rabbit) times the human exposure at the\nclinical dose of 450 mg, with no clear findings at lower doses (see Data). Advise\npregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nIn reproductive toxicity studies, administration of encorafenib to rats during the period\nof organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity, decreased fetal weights, and increased\nincidence of total skeletal variations at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 26 times\nthe human exposure based on area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] at the\nrecommended clinical dose of 450 mg once daily). In pregnant rabbits, administration of\nencorafenib during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity, decreased\nfetal body weights, increased incidence of total skeletal variations and increased post-\nimplantation loss, including total loss of pregnancy at a dose of 75 mg/kg/day\n(approximately 178 times the human exposure based on AUC at the recommended\nclinical dose of 450 mg once daily). While formal placental transfer studies have not been\nperformed, encorafenib exposure in the fetal plasma of both rats and rabbits was up to\n1.7% and 0.8%, respectively, of maternal exposure.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of encorafenib or its metabolites in human milk or the\neffects of encorafenib on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because\nof the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from BRAFTOVI, advise\nwomen not to breastfeed during treatment with BRAFTOVI and for 2 weeks after the\nlast dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nBRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.1)].\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating\nBRAFTOVI [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nContraception\nFemales\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment\nwith BRAFTOVI and for 2 weeks after the last dose. Counsel patients to use a non-\nhormonal method of contraception since BRAFTOVI has the potential to render\nhormonal contraceptives ineffective [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].\nInfertility\nMales\nBased on findings in male rats at doses approximately 13 times the human exposure at\nthe 450 mg clinical dose, use of BRAFTOVI may impact fertility in males [see Nonclinical\nToxicology (13.1)].\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of BRAFTOVI have not been established in pediatric\npatients.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the 690 patients with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma who received BRAFTOVI in\ncombination with binimetinib across multiple clinical trials, 20% were aged 65 to 74 years\nand 8% were aged 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].\nOf the 216 patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic CRC who received\nBRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab, 62 (29%) were 65 years of age to up to 75\nyears of age, while 20 (9%) were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].\nOf the 98 patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC who received\nBRAFTOVI with binimetinib, 62 (63%) were 65 years of age and over and 20 (20%) were\n75 years and over [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].\nNo overall differences in the safety or effectiveness of BRAFTOVI plus binimetinib or\nBRAFTOVI plus cetuximab were observed in older patients as compared to younger\npatients.\n8.6 Hepatic Impairment\nNo BRAFTOVI dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic\nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class A) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A recommended\ndosage has not been established in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or\nsevere (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.\n8.7 Renal Impairment\nNo BRAFTOVI dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild to moderate\nrenal impairment (CLcr 30 to <90 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A\nrecommended dosage has not been established in patients with severe renal impairment\n(CLcr <30 mL/min).\n10 OVERDOSAGE\nSince encorafenib is 86% bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is likely to be\nineffective in the treatment of overdose with BRAFTOVI.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nEncorafenib is a kinase inhibitor. The chemical name is methyl N-{(2S)-1-[(4-{3-[5-\nchloro-2-fluoro-3-(methanesulfonamido)phenyl]-1-(propan-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-\nyl}pyrimidin-2-yl)amino]propan-2-yl} carbamate. The molecular formula is\nC\nH\nClFN O S and the molecular weight is 540 daltons. The chemical structure of\nencorafenib is shown below:\nEncorafenib is a white to almost white powder. In aqueous media, encorafenib is slightly\nsoluble at pH 1, very slightly soluble at pH 2, and insoluble at pH 3 and higher.\nBRAFTOVI (encorafenib) capsules for oral use contain 75 mg of encorafenib with the\nfollowing inactive ingredients: copovidone, poloxamer 188, microcrystalline cellulose,\nsuccinic acid, crospovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate (vegetable\norigin). The capsule shell contains gelatin, titanium dioxide, iron oxide red, iron oxide\nyellow, ferrosoferric oxide, monogramming ink (pharmaceutical glaze, ferrosoferric\noxide, propylene glycol).\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nEncorafenib is a kinase inhibitor that targets BRAF V600E, as well as wild-type BRAF and\nCRAF in in vitro cell-free assays with IC\n values of 0.35, 0.47, and 0.3 nM, respectively.\nMutations in the BRAF gene, such as BRAF V600E, can result in constitutively activated\nBRAF kinases that may stimulate tumor cell growth. Encorafenib was also able to bind to\nother kinases in vitro including JNK1, JNK2, JNK3, LIMK1, LIMK2, MEK4, and STK36 and\nreduce ligand binding to these kinases at clinically achievable concentrations (\u22640.9 \u00b5M).\nEncorafenib inhibited in vitro growth of tumor cell lines expressing BRAF V600 E, D, and\nK mutations. In mice implanted with tumor cells expressing BRAF V600E, encorafenib\ninduced tumor regressions associated with RAF/MEK/ERK pathway suppression.\nEncorafenib and binimetinib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK\npathway. Compared with either drug alone, coadministration of encorafenib and\nbinimetinib resulted in greater anti-proliferative activity in vitro in BRAF mutation-positive\ncell lines and greater anti-tumor activity with respect to tumor growth inhibition in BRAF\n22\n27\n7\n4\n50\nV600E mutant human melanoma xenograft studies in mice. Additionally, the combination\nof encorafenib and binimetinib delayed the emergence of resistance in BRAF V600E\nmutant human melanoma xenografts in mice compared to either drug alone. In a BRAF\nV600E mutant NSCLC patient-derived xenograft model in mice, coadministration of\nencorafenib and binimetinib resulted in greater anti-tumor activity compared to\nbinimetinib alone, with respect to tumor growth inhibition. Increased tumor growth delay\nafter dosing cessation was also observed with the coadmnistration compared to either\ndrug alone.\nIn the setting of BRAF-mutant CRC, induction of EGFR-mediated MAPK pathway\nactivation has been identified as a mechanism of resistance to BRAF inhibitors.\nCombinations of a BRAF inhibitor and agents targeting EGFR have been shown to\novercome this resistance mechanism in nonclinical models. Coadministration of\nencorafenib and cetuximab had an anti-tumor effect greater than either drug alone, in a\nmouse model of colorectal cancer with mutated BRAF V600E.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nA dedicated study to evaluate the QT prolongation potential of BRAFTOVI has not been\nconducted. BRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation.\nBased on a central tendency analysis of QTc in a study of adult patients with melanoma\nwho received the recommended dose of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib, the\nlargest mean (90% CI) QTcF change from baseline (\u0394QTcF) was 18 (14 to 22) ms [see\nWarnings and Precautions (5.7)].\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of encorafenib were studied in healthy subjects and patients with\nsolid tumors, including advanced and unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma\nharboring a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation, BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic\nCRC. After a single dose, systemic exposure of encorafenib was dose proportional over\nthe dose range of 50 mg to 700 mg (0.1 to 1.6 times the maximum recommended dose\nof 450 mg). After once-daily dosing, systemic exposure of encorafenib was less than\ndose proportional over the dose range of 50 mg to 800 mg (0.1 to 1.8 times the\nmaximum recommended dose of 450 mg). Steady-state was reached within 15 days,\nwith exposure being 50% lower compared to Day 1; intersubject variability (CV%) of AUC\nranged from 12% to 69%.\nAbsorption\nThe median T\n of encorafenib is 2 hours. At least 86% of the dose is absorbed.\nEffect of Food\nFollowing administration of a single dose of BRAFTOVI 100 mg (0.2 times the maximum\nrecommended dose of 450 mg) with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (consisting of\napproximately 150 calories from protein, 350 calories from carbohydrates, and 500\ncalories from fat) the mean maximum encorafenib concentration (C\n) decreased by\n36% and there was no effect on AUC.\nDistribution\nThe geometric mean (CV%) of apparent volume of distribution is 164 L (70%). The\nmax\nmax\nprotein binding of encorafenib is 86% in vitro. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio is\n0.58.\nElimination\nThe mean (CV%) terminal half-life (t\n) of encorafenib is 3.5 hours (17%), and the\napparent clearance is 14 L/h (54%) at day 1, increasing to 32 L/h (59%) at steady-state\nat the maximum recommended dose of 450 mg.\nMetabolism\nEncorafenib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 (83%) and to a lesser extent by\nCYP2C19 (16%) and CYP2D6 (1%).\nExcretion\nFollowing a single radiolabeled dose of 100 mg encorafenib, 47% (5% unchanged) of the\nadministered dose was recovered in feces and 47% (2% unchanged) in urine.\nSpecific Populations\nNo clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of encorafenib were\nobserved based on age (19 to 94 years), sex, body weight (34 to 168 kg), mild hepatic\nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class A), and mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to\n<90 mL/min). The effect of race or ethnicity, moderate or severe hepatic impairment\n(Child-Pugh Class B or C), and severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) on\nencorafenib pharmacokinetics have not been studied.\nDrug Interaction Studies\nClinical Studies\nCYP3A4 Inhibitors: Coadministration of posaconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) or\ndiltiazem (moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased AUC of encorafenib by 3- and 2-fold,\nrespectively, and increased C\n by 68% and 45%, respectively, after a single dose of\n50 mg BRAFTOVI (0.1 times the maximum recommended dose of 450 mg).\nStrong CYP3A4 Inducers: The effect of a strong CYP3A4 inducer on encorafenib\nexposure has not been studied [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].\nModerate CYP3A4 Inducers: Repeat dose administration of BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily\nand binimetinib 45 mg twice daily with modafinil, a moderate CYP3A4 inducer, decreased\nencorafenib steady-state AUC by 24% and C\n by 20%, compared to BRAFTOVI alone.\nEffect of encorafenib on CYP3A4 Substrates: Repeat dose administration of BRAFTOVI\n450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily with a single dose of midazolam 2\nmg, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, decreased midazolam AUC by 82% and C\n by 74%\nrelative to midazolam 2 mg alone.\nEffect of encorafenib on Other CYP Substrates: There was no clinically significant effect\nof repeat dose administration of BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg\ntwice daily on the exposure of substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and\nCYP2D6.\nProton Pump Inhibitors: No clinically significant differences in encorafenib\npharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered with rabeprazole.\nBinimetinib: No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of binimetinib\n1/2\nmax\nmax\nmax\n(UGT1A1 substrate) were observed when coadministered with BRAFTOVI (UGT1A1\ninhibitor).\nCetuximab: No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of encorafenib or\ncetuximab were observed when the recommended BRAFTOVI dose of 300 mg was\ncoadministered with cetuximab.\nTransporters: Repeat dose administration of BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily and\nbinimetinib 45 mg twice daily with a single dose of rosuvastatin (a sensitive substrate for\nOATP1B1, OATP1B3, and BCRP) increased rosuvastatin C\n by 2.7-fold and AUC by\n1.6-fold.\nIn Vitro Studies\nCYP/UGT Enzymes: Encorafenib is a reversible inhibitor of UGT1A1.\nTransporters: Encorafenib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) but not of breast\ncancer resistance protein (BCRP), multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2),\norganic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1, OATP1B3) or organic cation\ntransporter (OCT1) at clinically relevant plasma concentrations.\nEncorafenib is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OCT2, organic anion transporter (OAT1,\nOAT3), OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, but not of OCT1 or MRP2 at clinically relevant plasma\nconcentrations.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies with encorafenib have not been conducted. Encorafenib was not\ngenotoxic in studies evaluating reverse mutations in bacteria, chromosomal aberrations\nin mammalian cells, or micronuclei in bone marrow of rats.\nNo dedicated fertility studies were performed with encorafenib in animals. In a general\ntoxicology study in rats, decreased testes and epididymis weights, tubular degeneration\nin testes, and oligospermia in epididymides were observed at doses approximately 13\ntimes the human exposure at the 450 mg clinical dose based on AUC. No effects on\nreproductive organs were observed in either sex in any of the non-human primate\ntoxicity studies.\n13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nAdverse histopathology findings of hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis occurred in the\nstomach of rats at encorafenib doses of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 14 times the\nhuman exposure at the 450 mg clinical dose based on AUC) or greater, in both 4 and\n13-week studies.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic\nMelanoma\nBRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was evaluated in a randomized, active-\nmax\ncontrolled, open-label, multicenter trial (COLUMBUS; NCT01909453). Eligible patients\nwere required to have BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or\nmetastatic melanoma, as detected using the bioMerieux THxID\u2122BRAF assay. Patients\nwere permitted to have received immunotherapy in the adjuvant setting and one prior\nline of immunotherapy for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. Prior use\nof BRAF inhibitors or MEK inhibitors was prohibited. Randomization was stratified by\nAmerican Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage (IIIB, IIIC, IVM1a or IVM1b, versus\nIVM1c), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 versus 1),\nand prior immunotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease (yes versus no).\nPatients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily in combination\nwith binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib), BRAFTOVI\n300 mg once daily, or vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily. Treatment continued until\ndisease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Only the results of the approved dosing\n(BRAFTOVI 450 mg in combination with binimetinib 45 mg) are described below.\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed\nby a blinded independent central review, to compare BRAFTOVI in combination with\nbinimetinib with vemurafenib. Additional efficacy outcome measures included overall\nsurvival (OS), as well as objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR)\nwhich were assessed by central review.\nA total of 577 patients were randomized, 192 to the BRAFTOVI in combination with\nbinimetinib arm, 194 to the BRAFTOVI arm, and 191 to the vemurafenib arm. Of the 383\npatients randomized to either the BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib or the\nvemurafenib arms, the median age was 56 years (20 to 89 years), 59% were male, 91%\nwere White, and 72% had baseline ECOG performance status of 0. Ninety-five percent\n(95%) had metastatic disease, 65% were Stage IVM1c, and 4% received prior CTLA-4,\nPD-1, or PD-L1 directed antibodies. Twenty-eight percent (28%) had elevated baseline\nserum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 45% had \u22653 organs with tumor involvement at\nbaseline, and 3% had brain metastases. Based on centralized testing, 100% of patients'\ntumors tested positive for BRAF mutations; BRAF V600E (88%), BRAF V600K (11%), or\nboth (<1%).\nBRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib demonstrated a statistically significant\nimprovement in PFS compared to vemurafenib.

Eligible patients\nwere required to have BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic colorectal cancer\n(CRC), as detected using the Qiagen therascreen BRAF V600E RGQ polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) Kit, with disease progression after 1 or 2 prior regimens. Other key\neligibility criteria included absence of prior treatment with a RAF, MEK, or EGFR inhibitor,\neligibility to receive cetuximab per local labeling with respect to tumor RAS status, and\nECOG performance status (PS) 0\u20131. Randomization was stratified by Eastern\nCooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 versus 1), prior use of\nirinotecan (yes versus no), and cetuximab product used (US-licensed versus EU-\napproved).\nPatients were randomized 1:1:1 to one of the following treatment arms:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nThe dosage of cetuximab in all patients was 400 mg/m  intravenously for the first dose\nfollowed by 250 mg/m  weekly.\nPatients in the control arm received cetuximab with either irinotecan 180 mg/m\nintravenously on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle or FOLFIRI intravenously\n(irinotecan 180 mg/m  on Days 1 and 15; folinic acid 400 mg/m  on Days 1 and 15; then\nfluorouracil 400 mg/m  bolus on Days 1 and 15 followed by fluorouracil 2400 mg/m /day\nby continuous infusion over 2 days).\nTreatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Only the results\nof the approved regimen (BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab) are described\nbelow.\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Additional efficacy\noutcome measures included progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate\n(ORR), and duration of response (DoR) as assessed by blinded independent central\nreview (BICR). OS and PFS were assessed in all randomized patients. ORR and DoR were\nassessed in the subset of the first 220 patients included in the randomized portion of\nthe BRAFTOVI/cetuximab and control arm of the study.\nA total of 220 patients were randomized to the BRAFTOVI/cetuximab arm and 221 to the\ncontrol arm. Of these 441 patients, the median age was 61 years; 53% were female;\n80% were White and 15% were Asian. Fifty percent (50%) had baseline ECOG\nperformance status of 0; 66% received 1 prior therapy and 34% received 2; 93%\nreceived prior oxaliplatin and 52% received prior irinotecan.\nBRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab demonstrated a statistically significant\nimprovement in OS, ORR, and PFS compared to the active comparator.

Eligible patients had a diagnosis of\nhistologically-confirmed metastatic NSCLC with BRAF V600E mutation that was\ntreatment-na\u00efve or had been previously treated with 1 prior line of systemic therapy in\nthe metastatic setting (platinum-based chemotherapy and/or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies),\nage 18 years or older, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status\n(PS) of 0 or 1, and measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in\nSolid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Prior use of BRAF inhibitors or MEK inhibitors was not\nallowed.\nPatients received BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg orally twice daily\nuntil disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome\nmeasures were objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 and duration of\nresponse (DoR) as assessed by independent review committee (IRC).\nIn the efficacy population, BRAF V600E mutation status was determined by prospective\nlocal testing using tumor tissue (78%) or blood (22%) specimens. Of the 98 patients\nwith BRAF V600E mutation, 6 patients were enrolled into the trial based on testing of\ntheir tumor tissue specimens with the FoundationOne CDx tissue test. Of the remaining\n92 patients enrolled based on local testing, 68 patients had their tumor tissue specimens\nretrospectively confirmed as having BRAF V600E positive status by the FoundationOne\nCDx tissue test. The remaining patients had either BRAF V600E negative status (n=5) or\nhad unevaluable results (n=19) by the FoundationOne CDx tissue test. In addition,\nplasma samples from 81 out of 98 patients were retrospectively tested using the\nFoundationOne Liquid CDx assay. Of the 81 patients, 48 were confirmed positive for\nBRAF V600E, while 33 patients were BRAF V600E mutation negative by FoundationOne\nLiquid CDx assay.

Limiting the infusion of ABRAXANE to 30 minutes may reduce the risk of\ninfusion-related reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].\nConsider premedication in patients who have had prior hypersensitivity reactions to\nABRAXANE. Do not re-challenge patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity\n\u00ae\nDo not administer ABRAXANE therapy to patients with baseline\nneutrophil counts of less than 1,500 cells/mm\n[see\nContraindications (4)].\n3 \nMonitor for neutropenia, which may be severe and result in\ninfection or sepsis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)].\nPerform frequent complete blood cell counts on all patients\nreceiving ABRAXANE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)].\nreaction to ABRAXANE [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].\n2.2 Recommended Dosage for Metastatic Breast Cancer\nAfter failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer or relapse within\n6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy, the recommended regimen for ABRAXANE is 260\nmg/m  administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks.\n2.3 Recommended Dosage for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\nThe recommended dose of ABRAXANE is 100 mg/m  administered as an intravenous\ninfusion over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle. Administer\ncarboplatin on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle immediately after ABRAXANE [see Clinical\nStudies (14.2)].\n2.4 Recommended Dosage for Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas\nThe recommended dose of ABRAXANE is 125 mg/m  administered as an intravenous\ninfusion over 30-40 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Administer\ngemcitabine immediately after ABRAXANE on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle\n[see Clinical Studies (14.3)].\n2.5 Dosage Modifications for Hepatic Impairment\nFor patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, reduce the starting dose of\nABRAXANE as shown in Table 1.\nTable 1: Recommendations for Starting Dose in Patients with Moderate and\nSevere Hepatic Impairment\nAST = Aspartate Aminotransferase; MBC = Metastatic Breast Cancer; NSCLC = Non-\nSmall Cell Lung Cancer; ULN = Upper limit of normal.\n Dosage recommendations are for the first course of therapy. The need for further\ndose adjustments in subsequent courses should be based on individual tolerance.\n A dose increase to 260 mg/m  for patients with metastatic breast cancer or 100\nmg/m  for patients with non-small cell lung cancer in subsequent courses should be\nconsidered if the patient tolerates the reduced dose for two cycles.\n Patients with bilirubin levels above the upper limit of normal were excluded from clinical\ntrials for pancreatic or lung cancer.\nAST\nLevels\nBilirubin\nLevels\nABRAXANE Dose\nMBC\nNSCLC \nAdenocarcinoma\nof Pancreas\nModerate\n< 10 x\nULN\nAND\n> 1.5 to \u2264\n3 x ULN\n200 mg/m\n80 mg/m\nnot recommended\nSevere\n< 10 x\nULN\nAND\n> 3 to \u2264 5\nx ULN\n200 mg/m\n80 mg/m\nnot recommended\n> 10 x\nULN\nOR\n> 5 x ULN\nnot\nrecommended\nnot\nrecommended\nnot recommended\n2.6 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions\n2\n2\n2\na\nb\n2\n2\nc\na\nc\nc\n2 b\n2 b\n2 b\n2 b\nMetastatic Breast Cancer \nPatients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophils less than 500 cells/mm  for a\nweek or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during ABRAXANE therapy should have\ndosage reduced to 220 mg/m  for subsequent courses of ABRAXANE.

Follow applicable special handling and disposal\nprocedures.  The use of gloves is recommended. If ABRAXANE (lyophilized cake or\nreconstituted suspension) contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly\nwith soap and water. Following topical exposure to paclitaxel, events may include\ntingling, burning, and redness. If ABRAXANE contacts mucous membranes, the\nmembranes should be flushed thoroughly with water.\nABRAXANE is supplied as a sterile lyophilized powder for reconstitution before use.\nRead the entire preparation instructions prior to reconstitution.\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\nEach mL of the reconstituted formulation will contain 5 mg/mL paclitaxel.\nThe reconstituted suspension should be milky and homogenous without visible\n1\nAseptically, reconstitute each vial by injecting 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride\nInjection, USP.\nSlowly inject the 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, over a minimum of\n1 minute, using the\nsterile syringe to direct the solution flow onto the INSIDE WALL OF THE VIAL.\nDO NOT INJECT the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, directly onto the\nlyophilized cake as this\nwill result in foaming.\nOnce the injection is complete, allow the vial to sit for a minimum of 5 minutes to\nensure proper wetting of\nthe lyophilized cake/powder.\nGently swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for at least 2 minutes until complete\ndissolution of any cake/powder\noccurs. Avoid generation of foam.\nIf foaming or clumping occurs, stand solution for at least 15 minutes until foam\nsubsides.\nparticulates. If particulates or settling are visible, the vial should be gently inverted again\nto ensure complete resuspension prior to use. Discard the reconstituted suspension if\nprecipitates are observed. Discard any unused portion.\nCalculate the exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/mL suspension required for the patient\nand slowly withdraw the dosing volume of the reconstituted suspension from the vial(s)\ninto a syringe: Dosing volume (mL)=Total dose (mg)/5 (mg/mL).\nInject the appropriate amount of reconstituted ABRAXANE into an empty, sterile\nintravenous bag [plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) containers, PVC or non-PVC type\nintravenous bag]. The use of specialized DEHP-free solution containers or administration\nsets is not necessary to prepare or administer ABRAXANE infusions. The use of medical\ndevices containing silicone oil as a lubricant (i.e., syringes and intravenous bags) to\nreconstitute and administer ABRAXANE may result in the formation of proteinaceous\nstrands.\nVisually inspect the reconstituted ABRAXANE suspension in the intravenous bag prior to\nadministration. Discard the reconstituted suspension if proteinaceous strands,\nparticulate matter, or discoloration are observed.\n2.8 Stability\nUnopened vials of ABRAXANE are stable until the date indicated on the package when\nstored between 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F) in the original package. Neither freezing\nnor refrigeration adversely affects the stability of the product.\nStability of Reconstituted Suspension in the Vial \nReconstituted ABRAXANE in the vial should be used immediately, but may be\nrefrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for a maximum of 24 hours if necessary. If not\nused immediately, each vial of reconstituted suspension should be replaced in the\noriginal carton to protect it from bright light. Discard any unused portion.\nStability of Reconstituted Suspension in the Infusion Bag \nThe suspension for infusion when prepared as recommended in an infusion bag should\nbe used immediately, but may be refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) and\nprotected from bright light for a maximum of 24 hours.\nThe total combined refrigerated storage time of reconstituted ABRAXANE in the vial and\nin the infusion bag is 24 hours. This may be followed by storage in the infusion bag at\nambient temperature (approximately 25\u00b0C) and lighting conditions for a maximum of 4\nhours.\nDiscard any unused portion.\n3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nFor injectable suspension, for intravenous use: white to yellow, sterile lyophilized powder\ncontaining 100 mg of paclitaxel formulated as albumin-bound particles in single-dose vial\nfor reconstitution.\n4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nABRAXANE is contraindicated in patients with:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n5.1 Severe Myelosuppression\nSevere myelosuppression (primarily neutropenia) is dose-dependent and a dose-limiting\ntoxicity of ABRAXANE. In clinical studies, Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 34% of\npatients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), 47% of patients with non-small cell lung\ncancer (NSCLC), and 38% of patients with pancreatic cancer.\nMonitor for severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia by performing complete blood\ncell counts frequently, including prior to dosing on Day 1 (for MBC) and Days 1, 8, and\n15 (for NSCLC and for pancreatic cancer). Do not administer ABRAXANE to patients\nwith baseline absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) of less than 1,500 cells/mm3 [see\nContraindications (4)].\nIn the case of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm  for seven days or more) during a\ncourse of ABRAXANE therapy, reduce the dose of ABRAXANE in subsequent courses in\npatients with either MBC or NSCLC.\nIn patients with MBC, resume treatment with every-3-week cycles of ABRAXANE after\nANC recovers to a level >1,500 cells/mm  and platelets recover to a level >100,000\ncells/mm . In patients with NSCLC, resume treatment if recommended at permanently\nreduced doses for both weekly ABRAXANE and every-3-week carboplatin after ANC\nrecovers to at least 1500 cells/mm  and platelet count of at least 100,000 cells/mm  on\nDay 1 or to an ANC of at least 500 cells/mm  and platelet count of at least 50,000\ncells/mm  on Days 8 or 15 of the cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].\nIn patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, withhold ABRAXANE and gemcitabine\nif the ANC is less than 500 cells/mm  or platelets are less than 50,000 cells/mm  and\ndelay initiation of the next cycle if the ANC is less than 1500 cells/mm  or platelet count\nis less than 100,000 cells/mm  on Day 1 of the cycle. Resume treatment with\nappropriate dose reduction if recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].\n5.2 Severe Neuropathy\nSensory neuropathy is dose- and schedule-dependent [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. If\n\u2265 Grade 3 sensory neuropathy develops, withhold ABRAXANE treatment until resolution\nto Grade 1 or 2 for metastatic breast cancer or until resolution to \u2264 Grade 1 for NSCLC\nand pancreatic cancer followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses of\nABRAXANE [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].\n5.3 Sepsis\nSepsis occurred in 5% of patients with or without neutropenia who received ABRAXANE\nin combination with gemcitabine. Biliary obstruction or presence of biliary stent were risk\nfactors for severe or fatal sepsis. If a patient becomes febrile (regardless of ANC) initiate\ntreatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. For febrile neutropenia, interrupt ABRAXANE\nBaseline neutrophil counts of < 1,500 cells/mm [see Warnings and Precautions\n(5.1)]\n3\nA history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to ABRAXANE [see Warnings and\nPrecautions (5.5)]\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\nand gemcitabine until fever resolves and ANC \u2265 1500, then resume treatment at\nreduced dose levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].\n5.4 Pneumonitis\nPneumonitis, including some cases that were fatal, occurred in 4% of patients receiving\nABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine.\nMonitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and interrupt ABRAXANE and\ngemcitabine during evaluation of suspected pneumonitis. After ruling out infectious\netiology and upon making a diagnosis of pneumonitis, permanently discontinue\ntreatment with ABRAXANE and gemcitabine.\n5.5 Severe Hypersensitivity\nSevere and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions,\nhave been reported. Do not rechallenge patients who experience a severe\nhypersensitivity reaction to ABRAXANE with this drug [see Contraindications (4)].\nCross-hypersensitivity between ABRAXANE and other taxane products has been\nreported and may include severe reactions such as anaphylaxis. Closely monitor\npatients with a previous history of hypersensitivity to other taxanes during initiation of\nABRAXANE therapy.\n5.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment\nThe exposure and toxicity of paclitaxel can be increased in patients with hepatic\nimpairment. Closely monitor patients with hepatic impairment for severe\nmyelosuppression.\nABRAXANE is not recommended in patients who have total bilirubin >5 x ULN or AST\n>10 x ULN. In addition, ABRAXANE is not recommended in patients with metastatic\nadenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have moderate to severe hepatic impairment\n(total bilirubin >1.5 x ULN and AST \u226410 x ULN). Reduce the starting dose for patients\nwith moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Use\nin Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n5.7 Albumin (Human)\nABRAXANE contains albumin (human), a derivative of human blood. Based on effective\ndonor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries a remote risk for\ntransmission of viral diseases. A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob\nDisease (CJD) also is considered extremely remote. No cases of transmission of viral\ndiseases or CJD have ever been identified for albumin.\n5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on mechanism of action and findings in animals, ABRAXANE can cause fetal harm\nwhen administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration\nof paclitaxel formulated as albumin-bound particles to rats during pregnancy at doses\nlower than the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area,\ncaused embryo-fetal toxicities, including intrauterine mortality, increased resorptions,\nreduced numbers of live fetuses, and malformations.\nAdvise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females\nof reproductive potential to use effective contraception and avoid becoming pregnant\nduring treatment with ABRAXANE and for at least six months after the last dose of\nABRAXANE [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].\nBased on findings from genetic toxicity and animal reproduction studies, advise male\npatients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception\nand avoid fathering a child during treatment with ABRAXANE and for at least three\nmonths after the last dose of ABRAXANE [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3),\nNonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) with single-agent use of ABRAXANE in\nmetastatic breast cancer are alopecia, neutropenia, sensory neuropathy, abnormal ECG,\nfatigue/asthenia, myalgia/arthralgia, AST elevation, alkaline phosphatase elevation,\nanemia, nausea, infections, and diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) of ABRAXANE in combination with\ncarboplatin for non-small cell lung cancer are anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia,\nalopecia, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, and fatigue [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The\nmost common serious adverse reactions of ABRAXANE in combination with carboplatin\nfor non-small cell lung cancer are anemia (4%) and pneumonia (3%). The most common\nadverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of ABRAXANE are neutropenia\n(3%), thrombocytopenia (3%), and peripheral neuropathy (1%). The most common\nadverse reactions resulting in dose reduction of ABRAXANE are neutropenia (24%),\nthrombocytopenia (13%), and anemia (6%). The most common adverse reactions\nleading to withholding or delay in ABRAXANE dosing are neutropenia (41%),\nthrombocytopenia (30%), and anemia (16%).\nIn a randomized open-label trial of ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine for\npancreatic adenocarcinoma [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], the most common (\u2265 20%)\nselected (with a \u2265 5% higher incidence) adverse reactions of ABRAXANE are\nneutropenia, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, alopecia, peripheral edema,\ndiarrhea, pyrexia, vomiting, decreased appetite, rash, and dehydration [see Adverse\nReactions (6.1)]. The most common serious adverse reactions of ABRAXANE (with a \u2265\n1% higher incidence) are pyrexia (6%), dehydration (5%), pneumonia (4%), and vomiting\n(4%). The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of\nABRAXANE are peripheral neuropathy (8%), fatigue (4%), and thrombocytopenia (2%).\nThe most common adverse reactions resulting in dose reduction of ABRAXANE are\nneutropenia (10%) and peripheral neuropathy (6%). The most common adverse\nreactions leading to withholding or delay in ABRAXANE dosing are neutropenia (16%),\nthrombocytopenia (12%), fatigue (8%), peripheral neuropathy (15%), anemia (5%), and\ndiarrhea (5%).\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nMetastatic Breast Cancer\nTable 6 shows the frequency of important adverse reactions in the randomized\ncomparative trial for the patients who received either single-agent ABRAXANE or\npaclitaxel injection for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.\nTable 6: Adverse Reactions in the Randomized Metastatic Breast Cancer\nStudy on an Every-3-Weeks Schedule\nPercent of Patients\nABRAXANE \n260 mg/m  over 30\nmin \n(n=229)\nPaclitaxel Injection \n175 mg/m  over 3 h  \n(n=225)\nBone Marrow\n Neutropenia\n   < 2.0 x 10 /L\n80\n82\n   < 0.5 x 10 /L\n9\n22\n Thrombocytopenia\n   < 100 x 10 /L\n2\n3\n   < 50 x 10 /L\n<1\n<1\n Anemia\n   < 11 g/dL\n33\n25\n   < 8 g/dL\n1\n<1\n Infections\n24\n20\n Febrile Neutropenia\n2\n1\n Neutropenic Sepsis\n<1\n<1\n Bleeding\n2\n2\nHypersensitivity Reaction\n All\n4\n12\n Severe\n0\n2\nCardiovascular\n Vital Sign Changes During\nAdministration\n   Bradycardia\n<1\n<1\n   Hypotension\n5\n5\n Severe Cardiovascular Events\n3\n4\nAbnormal ECG\n All Patients\n60\n52\n Patients with Normal Baseline\n35\n30\nRespiratory\n Cough\n7\n6\n Dyspnea\n12\n9\nSensory Neuropathy\n Any Symptoms\n71\n56\n Severe Symptoms\n10\n2\nMyalgia / Arthralgia\n Any Symptoms\n44\n49\n2\n2\na\n9\n9\n9\n9\nb\nc\nc\nc\nc\n Paclitaxel injection patients received premedication.\n Includes treatment-related events related to hypersensitivity (e.g., flushing, dyspnea,\nchest pain, hypotension) that began on a day of dosing.\n Severe events are defined as at least Grade 3 toxicity.\n Severe Symptoms\n8\n4\nAsthenia\n Any Symptoms\n47\n39\n Severe Symptoms\n8\n3\nFluid Retention/Edema\n Any Symptoms\n10\n8\n Severe Symptoms\n0\n<1\nGastrointestinal\n Nausea\n   Any Symptoms\n30\n22\n   Severe Symptoms\n3\n<1\n Vomiting\n   Any Symptoms\n18\n10\n   Severe Symptoms\n4\n1\n Diarrhea\n   Any Symptoms\n27\n15\n   Severe Symptoms\n<1\n1\n  Mucositis\n   Any Symptoms\n7\n6\n   Severe Symptoms\n<1\n0\nAlopecia\n90\n94\nHepatic (Patients with Normal\nBaseline)\n Bilirubin Elevations\n7\n7\n Alkaline Phosphatase Elevations\n36\n31\n AST (SGOT) Elevations\n39\n32\nInjection Site Reaction\n<1\n1\nOther Adverse Reactions\nHematologic Disorders \nNeutropenia was dose dependent and reversible. Among patients with metastatic breast\ncancer in the randomized trial, neutrophil counts declined below 500 cells/mm  (Grade 4)\nin 9% of the patients treated with a dose of 260 mg/m  compared to 22% in patients\nreceiving paclitaxel injection at a dose of 175 mg/m . Pancytopenia has been observed in\nclinical trials.\nInfections \nInfectious episodes were reported in 24% of the patients treated with ABRAXANE. Oral\ncandidiasis, respiratory tract infections and pneumonia were the most frequently\nreported infectious complications.\nHypersensitivity Reactions (HSRs) \nGrade 1 or 2 HSRs occurred on the day of ABRAXANE administration and consisted of\na\nb\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\n3\n2\n2\ndyspnea (1%) and flushing, hypotension, chest pain, and arrhythmia (all <1%). The use\nof ABRAXANE in patients previously exhibiting hypersensitivity to paclitaxel injection or\nhuman albumin has not been studied.\nCardiovascular \nHypotension, during the 30-minute infusion, occurred in 5% of patients. Bradycardia,\nduring the 30-minute infusion, occurred in <1% of patients. These vital sign changes\nmost often caused no symptoms and required neither specific therapy nor treatment\ndiscontinuation.\nSevere cardiovascular events possibly related to single-agent ABRAXANE occurred in\napproximately 3% of patients. These events included cardiac ischemia/infarction, chest\npain, cardiac arrest, supraventricular tachycardia, edema, thrombosis, pulmonary\nthromboembolism, pulmonary emboli, and hypertension. Cases of cerebrovascular\nattacks (strokes) and transient ischemic attacks have been reported.\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities were common among patients at baseline. ECG\nabnormalities on study did not usually result in symptoms, were not dose-limiting, and\nrequired no intervention. ECG abnormalities were noted in 60% of patients. Among\npatients with a normal ECG prior to study entry, 35% of all patients developed an\nabnormal tracing while on study. The most frequently reported ECG modifications were\nnon-specific repolarization abnormalities, sinus bradycardia, and sinus tachycardia.\nRespiratory \nDyspnea (12%), cough (7%), and pneumothorax (<1%) were reported after treatment\nwith ABRAXANE.\nNeurologic \nThe frequency and severity of sensory neuropathy increased with cumulative dose.\nSensory neuropathy was the cause of ABRAXANE discontinuation in 7/229 (3%)\npatients. Twenty-four patients (10%) treated with ABRAXANE developed Grade 3\nperipheral neuropathy; of these patients, 14 had documented improvement after a\nmedian of 22 days; 10 patients resumed treatment at a reduced dose of ABRAXANE and\n2 discontinued due to peripheral neuropathy. Of the 10 patients without documented\nimprovement, 4 discontinued the study due to peripheral neuropathy.\nNo Grade 4 sensory neuropathies were reported. Only one incident of motor\nneuropathy (Grade 2) was observed in either arm of the controlled trial.\nVision Disorders \nOcular/visual disturbances occurred in 13% of all patients (n=366) treated with\nABRAXANE and 1% were severe. The severe cases (keratitis and blurred vision) were\nreported in patients who received higher doses than those recommended (300 or 375\nmg/m ). These effects generally have been reversible.\nArthralgia/Myalgia \nThe symptoms were usually transient, occurred two or three days after ABRAXANE\nadministration, and resolved within a few days.\nHepatic \nGrade 3 or 4 elevations in GGT were reported for 14% of patients treated with\nABRAXANE and 10% of patients treated with paclitaxel injection in the randomized trial.\nRenal \nOverall 11% of patients experienced creatinine elevation, 1% severe. No\n2\ndiscontinuations, dose reductions, or dose delays were caused by renal toxicities.\nOther Clinical Events \nNail changes (changes in pigmentation or discoloration of nail bed) have been reported.\nEdema occurred in 10% of patients; no patients had severe edema. Dehydration and\npyrexia were also reported.\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer\nAdverse reactions were assessed in 514 ABRAXANE/carboplatin-treated patients and\n524 paclitaxel injection/carboplatin-treated patients receiving first-line systemic treatment\nfor locally advanced (stage IIIB) or metastatic (IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in\na multicenter, randomized, open-label trial. ABRAXANE was administered as an\nintravenous infusion over 30 minutes at a dose of 100 mg/m  on Days 1, 8, and 15 of\neach 21-day cycle. Paclitaxel injection was administered as an intravenous infusion over\n3 hours at a dose of 200 mg/m , following premedication. In both treatment arms\ncarboplatin at a dose of AUC = 6 mg\u2022min/mL was administered intravenously on Day 1\nof each 21-day cycle after completion of ABRAXANE/paclitaxel infusion.\nThe differences in paclitaxel dose and schedule between the two arms limit direct\ncomparison of dose- and schedule-dependent adverse reactions. Among patients\nevaluable for adverse reactions, the median age was 60 years, 75% were men, 81%\nwere White, 49% had adenocarcinoma, 43% had squamous cell lung cancer, 76% were\nECOG PS 1. Patients in both treatment arms received a median of 6 cycles of treatment.\nThe following common (\u2265 10% incidence) adverse reactions were observed at a similar\nincidence in ABRAXANE plus carboplatin-treated and paclitaxel injection plus carboplatin-\ntreated patients: alopecia 56%, nausea 27%, fatigue 25%, decreased appetite 17%,\nasthenia 16%, constipation 16%, diarrhea 15%, vomiting 12%, dyspnea 12%, and rash\n10% (incidence rates are for the ABRAXANE plus carboplatin treatment group).\nTable 7 provides the frequency and severity of laboratory-detected abnormalities which\noccurred with a difference of \u2265 5% for all grades (1-4) or \u2265 2% for Grade 3-4 toxicity\nbetween ABRAXANE plus carboplatin-treated patients or paclitaxel injection plus\ncarboplatin-treated patients.\nTable 7: Selected Hematologic Laboratory-Detected Abnormalities with a\nDifference of \u2265 5% for grades (1-4) or \u2265 2% for Grade 3-4 Toxicity Between\nTreatment Groups\n 508 patients assessed in ABRAXANE/carboplatin-treated group.\n 514 patients assessed in paclitaxel injection/carboplatin-treated group.\n 513 patients assessed in paclitaxel injection/carboplatin-treated group.\nABRAXANE (100 mg/m\nweekly) \nplus carboplatin\nPaclitaxel Injection (200\nmg/m  every 3 weeks)\nplus carboplatin\nGrades 1-4 (%)\nGrade 3-4\n(%)\nGrades 1-4\n(%)\nGrade 3-4\n(%)\nAnemia\n98\n28\n91\n7\nNeutropenia\n85\n47\n83\n58\nThrombocytopenia\n68\n18\n55\n9\n2\n2\n1\n2\n3\n2\n2\n1,2\n1,3\n1,3\nTable 8 provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions, which occurred with a\ndifference of \u2265 5% for all grades (1-4) or \u2265 2% for Grade 3-4 between either treatment\ngroup for the 514 ABRAXANE plus carboplatin-treated patients compared with the 524\npatients who received paclitaxel injection plus carboplatin.\nTable 8: Selected Adverse Reactions with a Difference of \u22655% for All Grade\nToxicity or \u22652% for Grade 3-4 Toxicity Between Treatment Groups\n Peripheral neuropathy is defined by the MedDRA Version 14.0 SMQ neuropathy (broad\nscope).\nSystem Organ\nClass\nAdverse\nReaction\nABRAXANE (100 mg/m\nweekly) \n+ carboplatin \n(N=514)\nPaclitaxel Injection (200\nmg/m  \nevery 3 weeks) +\ncarboplatin \n(N=524)\nGrade 1-4 \nToxicity \n(%)\nGrade 3-4 \nToxicity \n(%)\nGrades 1-4 \nToxicity \n(%)\nGrade 3-4 \nToxicity \n(%)\nNervous system\ndisorders\nPeripheral\nneuropathy\n48\n3\n64\n12\nGeneral\ndisorders and\nadministration\nsite conditions\nEdema\nperipheral\n10\n0\n4\n<1\nRespiratory\nthoracic and\nmediastinal\ndisorders\nEpistaxis\n7\n0\n2\n0\nMusculoskeletal\nand connective\ntissue disorders\nArthralgia\n13\n<1\n25\n2\nMyalgia\n10\n<1\n19\n2\nFor the ABRAXANE plus carboplatin treated group, 17/514 (3%) patients developed\nGrade 3 peripheral neuropathy and no patients developed Grade 4 peripheral\nneuropathy.

The median time to first occurrence\nof Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy in the ABRAXANE arm was 140 days. Upon\nsuspension of ABRAXANE dosing, the median time to improvement from Grade 3\nperipheral neuropathy to \u2264 Grade 1 was 29 days. Of ABRAXANE-treated patients with\nGrade 3 peripheral neuropathy, 44% resumed ABRAXANE at a reduced dose.\nSepsis \nSepsis occurred in 5% of patients who received ABRAXANE/gemcitabine compared to\n2% of patients who received gemcitabine alone.

Cross-hypersensitivity between\nABRAXANE and other taxanes has been reported.\nCardiovascular\nCongestive heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and atrioventricular block. Most\npatients were previously exposed to cardiotoxic drugs, such as anthracyclines, or had\nunderlying cardiac history.\nRespiratory\nPneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism\nRadiation pneumonitis in patients receiving concurrent radiotherapy.\nLung fibrosis has been reported with paclitaxel injection.\nNeurologic\nCranial nerve palsies and vocal cord paresis, as well as autonomic neuropathy resulting\nin paralytic ileus.\nVision Disorders\nReduced visual acuity due to cystoid macular edema (CME). After cessation of\ntreatment, CME may improve, and visual acuity may return to baseline. Abnormal visual\nevoked potentials in patients treated with paclitaxel injection suggest persistent optic\nnerve damage.\nHepatic\nHepatic necrosis and hepatic encephalopathy leading to death in patients treated with\npaclitaxel injection.\nGastrointestinal (GI)\nIntestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, pancreatitis, and ischemic colitis. In patients\ntreated with paclitaxel injection, neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis) despite the\ncoadministration of G-CSF, alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutic\nagents.\nInjection Site Reaction\nExtravasation. Closely monitor the ABRAXANE infusion site for possible infiltration during\ndrug administration [see Dosage and Administration 2.1)].\nSevere events such as phlebitis, cellulitis, induration, necrosis, and fibrosis have been\nreported with paclitaxel injection. In some cases, the onset of the injection site reaction\noccurred during a prolonged infusion or was delayed up to ten days. Recurrence of skin\nreactions at a site of previous extravasation following administration of paclitaxel\ninjection at a different site has been reported.\nMetabolic and Nutritional Disorders\nTumor lysis syndrome\nOther Clinical Events\nSkin reactions including generalized or maculopapular rash, erythema, and pruritus.\nPhotosensitivity reactions, radiation recall phenomenon, scleroderma, and in some\npatients previously exposed to capecitabine, reports of palmar-plantar\nerythrodysesthesia. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have\nbeen reported.\nConjunctivitis, cellulitis, and increased lacrimation have been reported with paclitaxel\ninjection.\nAccidental Exposure\nUpon inhalation of paclitaxel, dyspnea, chest pain, burning eyes, sore throat, and\nnausea have been reported.\nFollowing topical exposure, tingling, burning, and redness have been reported.\n7 DRUG INTERACTIONS\nThe metabolism of paclitaxel is catalyzed by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Caution should be\nexercised when administering ABRAXANE concomitantly with medicines known to inhibit\nor induce either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4.\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ABRAXANE can cause fetal\nharm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There\nare no available human data on ABRAXANE use in pregnant women to inform the drug-\nassociated risk.\nIn animal reproduction studies, administration of paclitaxel formulated as albumin-bound\nparticles to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal\ntoxicity at doses approximately 2% of the daily maximum recommended human dose on\na mg/m  basis (see Data). Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk\nto a fetus.\nThe background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the\nindicated population. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of\nmajor birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and\n15% to 20%, respectively.\n2\nData\nAnimal Data\nIn embryo-fetal development studies, intravenous administration of paclitaxel formulated\nas albumin-bound particles to rats during pregnancy, on gestation days 7 to 17 at doses\nof 6 mg/m  (approximately 2% of the daily maximum recommended human dose on a\nmg/m  basis) caused embryo-fetal toxicities, as indicated by intrauterine mortality,\nincreased resorptions (up to 5-fold), reduced numbers of litters and live fetuses,\nreduction in fetal body weight, and increase in fetal anomalies. Fetal anomalies included\nsoft tissue and skeletal malformations, such as eye bulge, folded retina, microphthalmia,\nand dilation of brain ventricles.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of paclitaxel in human milk, or its effect on the\nbreastfed child or on milk production. In animal studies, paclitaxel and/or its metabolites\nwere excreted into the milk of lactating rats (see Data). Because of the potential for\nserious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from ABRAXANE, advise lactating women\nnot to breastfeed during treatment with ABRAXANE and for two weeks after the last\ndose.\nData\nAnimal Data\nFollowing intravenous administration of radiolabeled paclitaxel to rats on days 9 to 10\npostpartum, concentrations of radioactivity in milk were higher than in plasma and\ndeclined in parallel with the plasma concentrations.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nBased on animal studies and mechanism of action, ABRAXANE can cause fetal\nharm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific\nPopulations (8.1)].\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to starting\ntreatment with ABRAXANE.\nContraception\nFemales\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception and avoid\nbecoming pregnant during treatment with ABRAXANE and for at least six months after\nthe last dose of ABRAXANE.\nMales\nBased on findings in genetic toxicity and animal reproduction studies, advise males with\nfemale partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception and avoid\nfathering a child during treatment with ABRAXANE and for at least three months after\nthe last dose of ABRAXANE [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Nonclinical\n2\n2\nToxicology (13.1)].\nInfertility\nFemales and Males\nBased on findings in animals, ABRAXANE may impair fertility in females and males of\nreproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\nPharmacokinetics, safety, and antitumor activity of ABRAXANE were assessed in an\nopen-label, dose escalation, dose expansion study (NCT01962103) in 96 pediatric\npatients aged 1.4 to < 17 years with recurrent or refractory pediatric solid tumors. The\nmaximum tolerated dose (MTD) normalized for body surface area (BSA) was lower in\npediatric patients compared to adults. No new safety signals were observed in pediatric\npatients across these studies.\nPaclitaxel protein-bound exposures normalized by dose were higher in 96 pediatric\npatients (aged 1.4 to < 17 years) as compared to those in adults.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the 229 patients in the randomized study who received ABRAXANE for the treatment\nof metastatic breast cancer, 13% were at least 65 years of age and < 2% were 75 years\nor older. This study of ABRAXANE did not include a sufficient number of patients with\nmetastatic breast cancer who were 65 years and older to determine whether they\nrespond differently from younger patients.\nA subsequent pooled analysis was conducted in 981 patients receiving ABRAXANE\nmonotherapy for metastatic breast cancer, of which 15% were 65 years of age or older\nand 2% were 75 years of age or older. A higher incidence of epistaxis, diarrhea,\ndehydration, fatigue, and peripheral edema was found in patients 65 years of age or\nolder.\nOf the 514 patients in the randomized study who received ABRAXANE and carboplatin\nfor the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, 31% were 65 years or older and\n3.5% were 75 years or older. Myelosuppression, peripheral neuropathy, and arthralgia\nwere more frequent in patients 65 years or older compared to patients younger than 65\nyears old. No overall difference in effectiveness, as measured by response rates, was\nobserved between patients 65 years or older compared to patients younger than 65\nyears old.\nOf the 431 patients in the randomized study who received ABRAXANE and gemcitabine\nfor the first-line treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 41% were 65 years or older\nand 10% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed\nbetween patients who were 65 years of age or older and younger patients. Diarrhea,\ndecreased appetite, dehydration, and epistaxis were more frequent in patients 65 years\nor older compared with patients younger than 65 years old. Clinical studies of\nABRAXANE did not include sufficient number of patients with pancreatic cancer who\nwere 75 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger\npatients.\n8.6 Renal Impairment\nNo adjustment of the starting ABRAXANE dose is required for patients with mild to\nmoderate renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance 30 to <90 mL/min) [see\nClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There are insufficient data to permit dosage\nrecommendations in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease\n(estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min).\n8.7 Hepatic Impairment\nNo adjustment of the starting ABRAXANE dose is required for patients with mild hepatic\nimpairment (total bilirubin > ULN and \u2264 1.5 x ULN and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]\n\u2264 10 x ULN). Reduce ABRAXANE starting dose in patients with moderate to severe\nhepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology\n(12.3)]. ABRAXANE is not recommended for use in patients with total bilirubin > 5 x ULN\nor AST > 10 x ULN [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions\n(5.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. ABRAXANE is not recommended for use in\npatients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have moderate to severe\nhepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\n10 OVERDOSAGE\nThere is no known antidote for ABRAXANE overdosage. The primary anticipated\ncomplications of overdosage would consist of bone marrow suppression, sensory\nneurotoxicity, and mucositis.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nABRAXANE for Injectable Suspension (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable\nsuspension) (albumin-bound) is paclitaxel formulated as albumin-bound nanoparticles\nwith a mean particle size of approximately 130 nanometers. Paclitaxel exists in the\nparticles in a non-crystalline, amorphous state. Paclitaxel is a microtubule inhibitor. The\nchemical name for paclitaxel is 5\u03b2,20-Epoxy-1,2\u03b1,4,7\u03b2,10\u03b2,13\u03b1-hexahydroxytax-11-en-\n9-one 4,10-diacetate 2-benzoate 13-ester with (2R,3S)-N-benzoyl-3-phenylisoserine. The\nempirical formula is C\nH\nNO\n and the molecular weight is 853.91. Paclitaxel has the\nfollowing structural formula:\nPaclitaxel is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is highly lipophilic, insoluble in\nwater, and melts at approximately 216\u00b0C to 217\u00b0C.\n47\n51\n14\nABRAXANE is supplied as a white to yellow, sterile, lyophilized powder for reconstitution\nwith 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP prior to intravenous infusion. Each\nsingle\u2011dose vial contains 100 mg of paclitaxel (bound to human albumin) and\napproximately 900 mg of human albumin (containing sodium caprylate and sodium\nacetyltryptophanate). Each milliliter (mL) of reconstituted suspension contains 5 mg\npaclitaxel formulated as albumin\u2011bound particles. ABRAXANE is free of solvents.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nABRAXANE is a microtubule inhibitor that promotes the assembly of microtubules from\ntubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization. This stability\nresults in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network\nthat is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. Paclitaxel induces\nabnormal arrays or \"bundles\" of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple\nasters of microtubules during mitosis.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30- and 180-minute infusions of\nABRAXANE at dose levels of 80 to 375 mg/m  (0.31 to 1.15 times the maximum\napproved recommended dosage) were determined in clinical studies. Dose levels of\nmg/m  refer to mg of paclitaxel in ABRAXANE. Following intravenous administration of\nABRAXANE to patients with solid tumors, paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a\nbiphasic manner, the initial rapid decline representing distribution to the peripheral\ncompartment and the slower second phase representing drug elimination.\nFollowing ABRAXANE infusion, paclitaxel exhibited linear drug exposure (AUC) across\nclinical doses ranging from 80 to 300 mg/m  (0.31 to 1.15 times the maximum\napproved recommended dosage). The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in ABRAXANE were\nindependent of the duration of intravenous administration.\nThe pharmacokinetic data of 260 mg/m  ABRAXANE administered over a 30-minute\ninfusion was compared to the pharmacokinetics of 175 mg/m  paclitaxel injection over a\n3-hour infusion. Clearance was larger (43%) and the volume of distribution was higher\n(53%) for ABRAXANE than for paclitaxel injection. There were no differences in terminal\nhalf-lives.\nDistribution \nFollowing ABRAXANE administration to patients with solid tumors, paclitaxel is evenly\ndistributed into blood cells and plasma and is highly bound to plasma proteins (94%).\nThe total volume of distribution is approximately 1741 L; the large volume of distribution\nindicates extensive extravascular distribution and/or tissue binding of paclitaxel.\nIn a within-patient comparison study, the fraction of unbound paclitaxel in plasma was\nsignificantly higher with ABRAXANE (6.2%) than with solvent-based paclitaxel (2.3%).\nThis contributes to significantly higher exposure to unbound paclitaxel with ABRAXANE\ncompared with solvent-based paclitaxel, when the total exposure is comparable. In vitro\nstudies of binding to human serum proteins, using paclitaxel concentrations ranging\nfrom 0.1 to 50 \u00b5g/mL, indicated that the presence of cimetidine, ranitidine,\ndexamethasone, or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel.\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nElimination \nAt the clinical dose range of 80 to 300 mg/m  (0.31 to 1.15 times the maximum\napproved recommended dosage), the mean total clearance of paclitaxel ranges from 13\nto 30 L/h/m  and the mean terminal half-life ranges from 13 to 27 hours.\nMetabolism \nIn vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices showed that paclitaxel in\nABRAXANE was metabolized primarily to 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel by CYP2C8; and to two\nminor metabolites, 3'-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6\u03b1, 3'-p-dihydroxypaclitaxel, by CYP3A4.\nIn vitro, the metabolism of paclitaxel to 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel was inhibited by a number\nof agents (ketoconazole, verapamil, diazepam, quinidine, dexamethasone, cyclosporin,\nteniposide, etoposide, and vincristine), but the concentrations used exceeded those\nfound in vivo following normal therapeutic doses. Testosterone, 17\u03b1-ethinyl estradiol,\nretinoic acid, and quercetin, a specific inhibitor of CYP2C8, also inhibited the formation of\n6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel in vitro. The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel may also be altered in\nvivo as a result of interactions with compounds that are substrates, inducers, or\ninhibitors of CYP2C8 and/or CYP3A4 [see Drug Interactions (7)].\nExcretion \nAfter a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg/m  doses of ABRAXANE, the mean values for\ncumulative urinary recovery of unchanged drug (4%) indicated extensive non-renal\nclearance. Less than 1% of the total administered dose was excreted in urine as the\nmetabolites 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3'-p-hydroxypaclitaxel. Fecal excretion was\napproximately 20% of the total dose administered.\nSpecific Populations\nNo clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in ABRAXANE\nwere observed based on body weight (40 to 143 kg), body surface area (1.3 to 2.4 m ),\nsex, race (Asian vs. White), age (24 to 85 years), type of solid tumors, mild to moderate\nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to <90 mL/min), and mild hepatic impairment\n(total bilirubin >1 to \u22641.5 x ULN and AST \u226410 x ULN).\nPatients with moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 x ULN and AST \u226410 x ULN) or severe\n(total bilirubin >3 to 5 x ULN) hepatic impairment had a 22% to 26% decrease in the\nmaximum elimination rate of paclitaxel and approximately 20% increase in mean\npaclitaxel AUC compared with patients with normal hepatic function (total bilirubin \u2264ULN\nand AST \u2264ULN) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use in Specific Populations\n(8.7)].\nThe effect of severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <\n30 mL/min) on the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in ABRAXANE is unknown.\nDrug Interaction Studies \nCarboplatin: Administration of carboplatin immediately after the completion of the\nABRAXANE infusion to patients with NSCLC did not cause clinically meaningful changes\nin paclitaxel exposure. The observed mean AUC\n of free carboplatin was approximately\n23% higher than the targeted value (6 min*mg/mL), but its mean half-life and clearance\nwere consistent with those reported in the absence of paclitaxel.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n2\n2\n2\n2\ninf\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nThe carcinogenic potential of ABRAXANE has not been studied.\nPaclitaxel was clastogenic in vitro (chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes) and\nin vivo (micronucleus test in mice). Paclitaxel was not mutagenic in the Ames test or the\nCHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay.\nAdministration of paclitaxel formulated as albumin-bound particles to male rats at 42\nmg/m  on a weekly basis (approximately 16% of the daily maximum recommended\nhuman exposure on a body surface area basis) for 11 weeks prior to mating with\nuntreated female rats resulted in significantly reduced fertility accompanied by\ndecreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. A dose of\n42 mg/m  also reduced male reproductive organ weights, mating performance, and\nsperm production. Testicular atrophy/degeneration was observed in single-dose\ntoxicology studies in animals administered paclitaxel formulated as albumin-bound\nparticles at doses lower than the recommended human dose; doses were 54 mg/m  in\nrodents and 175 mg/m in dogs. Similar testicular degeneration was seen in monkeys\nadministered three weekly doses of 108 mg/m  paclitaxel formulated as albumin bound\nparticles.\nAdministration of paclitaxel prior to and during mating produced impairment of fertility in\nmale and female rats. Paclitaxel caused reduced fertility and reproductive indices, and\nincreased embryo-fetal toxicity.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 Metastatic Breast Cancer\nData from 106 patients accrued in two single arm open label studies and from 460\npatients enrolled in a randomized comparative study were available to support the use of\nABRAXANE in metastatic breast cancer.\nSingle Arm Open Label Studies \nIn one study, ABRAXANE was administered as a 30-minute infusion at a dose of 175\nmg/m  to 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer. The second trial utilized a dose of\n300 mg/m  as a 30-minute infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer. Cycles\nwere administered at 3-week intervals. Objective responses were observed in both\nstudies.\nRandomized Comparative Study \nThis multicenter trial was conducted in 460 patients with metastatic breast cancer.\nPatients were randomized to receive ABRAXANE at a dose of 260 mg/m  given as a 30-\nminute infusion, or paclitaxel injection at 175 mg/m  given as a 3-hour infusion. Sixty-\nfour percent of patients had impaired performance status (ECOG 1 or 2) at study entry;\n79% had visceral metastases; and 76% had > 3 sites of metastases. Fourteen percent\nof the patients had not received prior chemotherapy; 27% had received chemotherapy\nin the adjuvant setting, 40% in the metastatic setting and 19% in both metastatic and\nadjuvant settings. Fifty-nine percent received study drug as second or greater than\nsecond-line therapy. Seventy-seven percent of the patients had been previously\nexposed to anthracyclines.\nIn this trial, patients in the ABRAXANE treatment arm had a statistically significantly\n2\n2\n2\n2 \n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nhigher reconciled target lesion response rate (the trial primary endpoint) of 21.5% (95%\nCI: 16.2% to 26.7%), compared to 11.1% (95% CI: 6.9% to 15.1%) for patients in the\npaclitaxel injection treatment arm. See Table 11. There was no statistically significant\ndifference in overall survival between the two study arms.\nTable 11: Efficacy Results from Randomized Metastatic Breast Cancer Trial\n Reconciled Target Lesion Response Rate (TLRR) was the prospectively defined\nprotocol specific endpoint, based on independent radiologic assessment of tumor\nresponses reconciled with investigator responses (which also included clinical\ninformation) for the first 6 cycles of therapy.

ABRAXANE was\nadministered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at a dose of 100 mg/m  on\nDays 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle. Paclitaxel injection was administered as an\nintravenous infusion over 3 hours at a dose of 200 mg/m , following premedication. In\nboth treatment arms carboplatin at a dose of AUC = 6 mg\u2022min/mL was administered\nintravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle after completion of ABRAXANE/paclitaxel\ninfusion. Treatment was administered until disease progression or development of an\nunacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate as\ndetermined by a central independent review committee using RECIST guidelines (Version\n1.0).\nIn the intent-to-treat (all-randomized) population, the median age was 60 years, 75%\nwere men, 81% were White, 49% had adenocarcinoma, 43% had squamous cell lung\ncancer, 76% were ECOG PS 1, and 73% were current or former smokers. Patients\nreceived a median of 6 cycles of treatment in both study arms.\na\nb\nst\nst\nc\n2\n2\na\nb\nc\n2\n2\nPatients in the ABRAXANE/carboplatin arm had a statistically significantly higher overall\nresponse rate compared to patients in the paclitaxel injection/carboplatin arm [(33%\nversus 25%) see Table 12].

Key eligibility criteria\nwere Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) \u226570, normal bilirubin level, transaminase\nlevels \u2264 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or \u2264 5 times the ULN for patients with\nliver metastasis, no prior cytotoxic chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting or for\nmetastatic disease, no ongoing active infection requiring systemic therapy, and no\nhistory of interstitial lung disease. Patients with rapid decline in KPS (\u226510%) or serum\nalbumin (\u226520%) during the 14 day screening period prior to study randomization were\nineligible.\nA total of 861 patients were randomized (1:1) to the ABRAXANE/gemcitabine arm\n(N=431) or to the gemcitabine arm (N=430).\nRandomization was stratified by geographic region (Australia, Western Europe, Eastern\nEurope, or North America), KPS (70 to 80 versus 90 to 100), and presence of liver\nmetastasis (yes versus no). Patients randomized to ABRAXANE/gemcitabine received\nABRAXANE 125 mg/m  as an intravenous infusion over 30-40 minutes followed by\n2\n2\n2\n2\ngemcitabine 1000 mg/m  as an intravenous infusion over 30-40 minutes on Days 1, 8,\nand 15 of each 28-day cycle. Patients randomized to gemcitabine received 1000 mg/m\nas an intravenous infusion over 30-40 minutes weekly for 7 weeks followed by a 1-week\nrest period in Cycle 1 then as 1000 mg/m  on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each subsequent 28-\nday cycle. Patients in both arms received treatment until disease progression or\nunacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS).\nAdditional outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response\nrate (ORR), both assessed by independent, central, blinded radiological review using\nRECIST (version 1.0).\nIn the intent-to-treat (all randomized) population, the median age was 63 years (range\n27-88 years) with 42% \u2265 65 years of age; 58% were men; 93% were White and KPS\nwas 90-100 in 60%. Disease characteristics included 46% of patients with 3 or more\nmetastatic sites; 84% of patients had liver metastasis; and the location of the primary\npancreatic lesion was in the head of pancreas (43%), body (31%), or tail (25%).\nResults for overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response rate are\nshown in Table 13.\nTable 13: Efficacy Results from Randomized Study in Patients with\nAdenocarcinoma of the Pancreas (ITT Population)\nCI = confidence interval, HR = hazard ratio of ABRAXANE plus gemcitabine /\ngemcitabine, ITT = intent-to-treat population.\n Stratified Cox proportional hazard model.\n Stratified log-rank test stratified by geographic region (North America versus Others),\nKarnofsky performance score (70 to 80 versus 90 to 100), and presence of liver\nABRAXANE (125\nmg/m ) \nand gemcitabine \n(N = 431)\nGemcitabine \n(N = 430)\nOverall Survival\nNumber of deaths, n (%)\n333 (77)\n359 (83)\n      Median Overall Survival (months)\n8.5\n6.7\n      95% CI\n7.9, 9.5\n6.0, 7.2\n      HR (95% CI) \n0.72 (0.62, 0.83)\n      P-value\n<0.0001\nProgression-free Survival\nDeath or progression, n (%)\n277 (64)\n265 (62)\n      Median Progression-free Survival\n(months)\n5.5\n3.7\n      95% CI\n4.5, 5.9\n3.6, 4.0\n      HR (95% CI) \n0.69 (0.58, 0.82)\n      P-value\n<0.0001\nOverall Response Rate\nConfirmed complete or partial overall\nresponse, n (%)\n99 (23)\n31 (7)\n      95% CI\n19.1, 27.2\n5.0, 10.1\n      P-value \n<0.0001\n2\n2\n2\na\nb\n2\na\nb\nc\na\nb\nc\nd\nmetastasis (yes versus no).\n Based on Independent Radiological Reviewer Assessment.\n Chi-square test.\nIn exploratory analyses conducted in clinically relevant subgroups with a sufficient\nnumber of subjects, the treatment effects on overall survival were similar to that\nobserved in the overall study population.\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier Curve of Overall Survival (Intent-to-Treat Population)\n15 REFERENCES\n1.

If\nconcomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors is unavoidable, reduce the dose of XALKORI\nto the second dose reduction shown in Table 4 for adult patients with NSCLC or IMT and\nTable 5 for pediatric patients with ALCL or IMT and young adults with ALCL. After\ndiscontinuation of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resume the XALKORI dose used prior to\ninitiating the strong CYP3A inhibitor.\n3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nCapsules:\n\u2022\n\u2022\nOral Pellets:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nNone.\n5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n5.1 Hepatotoxicity\ncr\n200 mg: hard gelatin capsule, size 1, white opaque body and pink opaque cap, with\n\"Pfizer\" on the cap and \"CRZ 200\" on the body.\n250 mg: hard gelatin capsule, size 0, pink opaque cap and body, with \"Pfizer\" on\nthe cap and \"CRZ 250\" on the body.\n20 mg: hard gelatin capsule, size 4, white opaque body and light blue opaque cap,\nprinted with black ink \u201cPfizer\u201d on the cap and \u201cCRZ 20\u201d on the body.\n50 mg: hard gelatin capsule, size 3, light gray opaque body and gray opaque cap,\nprinted with black ink \u201cPfizer\u201d on the cap and \u201cCRZ 50\u201d on the body.\n150 mg: hard gelatin capsule, size 0, light blue opaque body and cap, printed with\nblack ink \u201cPfizer\u201d on the cap and \u201cCRZ 150\u201d on the body.\nDrug-induced hepatotoxicity with fatal outcome occurred in 0.1% of the 1719 patients\ntreated with XALKORI for NSCLC across clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nConcurrent elevations in ALT or AST \u22653 times the ULN and total bilirubin \u22652 times the\nULN, with normal alkaline phosphatase, occurred in <1% of patients treated with\nXALKORI. Increased ALT or AST >5 times the ULN occurred in 11% and 6% of patients,\nrespectively. One percent (1.0%) of patients required permanent discontinuation due to\nelevated transaminases. Increased transaminases generally occurred within the first 2\nmonths of treatment.\nIn Study ADVL0912, of 121 patients ages 1 to \u226421 years treated with XALKORI for\nrelapsed or refractory tumors including ALCL and IMT, 71% and 79% had increases of\nAST and ALT, respectively, with increased ALT or AST >5 times the ULN in 6% each. Of\nthe 26 patients with ALCL treated with XALKORI, 65% and 81% had increases of AST\nand ALT, respectively, with increases >5 times the ULN in 4% each. Of the 14 pediatric\npatients with IMT treated with XALKORI, 71% had increases of AST and 71% had\nincreases of ALT.\nIn Study A8081013, of the 7 adult patients with IMT treated with XALKORI, 57% and\n43% had increases of AST and ALT, respectively.\nMonitor liver function tests, including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin, every 2 weeks during\nthe first 2 months of treatment, then once a month, and as clinically indicated, with\nmore frequent repeat testing for increased liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, or\ntotal bilirubin in patients who develop increased transaminases. Withhold, reduce dose,\nor permanently discontinue XALKORI for hepatotoxicity as recommended [see Dosage\nand Administration (2.6)].\n5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis\nSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis can occur in\npatients treated with XALKORI. Across clinical trials in patients with NSCLC (n=1719),\n2.9% of XALKORI-treated patients had ILD of any grade, 1% had Grade 3 or 4 ILD, and\n0.5% had fatal ILD [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Interstitial lung disease generally\noccurred within 3 months after the initiation of XALKORI.\nIn Study ADVL0912, among 121 patients ages 1 to \u226421 years with relapsed or\nrefractory tumors, including ALCL and IMT, ILD occurred in 0.8% of patients.\nMonitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Exclude other\npotential causes of ILD/pneumonitis, and permanently discontinue XALKORI in patients\ndiagnosed with drug-related ILD/pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].\n5.3 QT Interval Prolongation\nQTc prolongation can occur in patients treated with XALKORI. Across clinical trials in\npatients with NSCLC, 2.1% of 1616 patients had QTcF (corrected QT for heart rate by\nthe Fridericia method) greater than or equal to 500 ms and 5% of 1582 patients had an\nincrease from baseline QTcF greater than or equal to 60 ms by automated machine-read\nevaluation of ECGs.\nIn Study ADVL0912, QTc prolongation was reported as an adverse reaction in 4.1% of\npatients, including 8% of patients with ALCL and 7% of pediatric patients with IMT.\nAvoid use of XALKORI in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. Monitor ECGs and\nelectrolytes in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte\nabnormalities, or who are taking medications that are known to prolong the QT interval.\nWithhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue XALKORI for QT/QTc interval\nprolongation as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Clinical\nPharmacology (12.2)].\n5.4 Bradycardia\nSymptomatic bradycardia can occur in patients receiving XALKORI. Across clinical trials\nin patients with NSCLC, bradycardia occurred in 13% of 1719 patients treated with\nXALKORI. Grade 3 syncope occurred in 2.4% of XALKORI-treated patients and in 0.6%\nof the chemotherapy-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nIn Study ADVL0912, among 121 patients ages 1 to \u226421 years treated with XALKORI,\nbradycardia was reported in 14%, including Grade 3 bradycardia in 0.8% of patients. Of\nthe 26 patients with ALCL treated with XALKORI, bradycardia (all Grade 1) was reported\nin 19%. Of the 14 pediatric patients with IMT treated with XALKORI, bradycardia was\nreported in 14% of patients, including Grade 3 bradycardia in 7% of patients.\nAvoid using XALKORI in combination with other medications known to cause bradycardia\n(e.g., beta-blockers, nondihydropyridine-calcium channel blockers, clonidine, and\ndigoxin) to the extent possible. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. If\nbradycardia occurs, re-evaluate for the use of concomitant medications known to cause\nbradycardia. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue XALKORI for\nbradycardia as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].\n5.5 Severe Visual Loss\nAcross all clinical trials in patients with NSCLC, the incidence of Grade 4 visual field defect\nwith visual loss was 0.2% of 1719 patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Optic atrophy\nand optic nerve disorder have been reported as potential causes of visual loss.\nIn Study ADVL0912, visual disorders occurred in 46% of 121 patients with XALKORI,\nincluding 65% of 26 patients with ALCL and 50% of 14 patients with IMT. Of the 56\npatients who experienced visual disorders, one pediatric patient with IMT experienced\nGrade 3 myopic optic nerve disorder. The most common visual symptoms were blurred\nvision and visual impairment.\nAssessment of visual symptoms for all patients is recommended monthly during\ntreatment. Report new visual symptoms to an eye specialist.\nFor pediatric and young adult patients with ALCL or pediatric patients with IMT, obtain\nbaseline and follow-up ophthalmologic examinations including retinal examination within\n1 month of starting XALKORI and every 3 months thereafter. The ophthalmological\nevaluation should consist of best corrected visual acuity, retinal photographs, visual\nfields, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and other evaluations as appropriate [see\nDosage and Administration (2.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nPermanently discontinue XALKORI for Grade 3 or 4 ocular disorders or severe visual\nloss (best corrected vision less than 20/200 in one or both eyes) unless another cause\nis identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. There is insufficient information to\ncharacterize the risks of resumption of XALKORI in patients who develop visual\nsymptoms or visual loss. A decision to resume XALKORI should consider the potential\nbenefits versus risks to the patient.\n5.6 Gastrointestinal Toxicity in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients with ALCL\nor Pediatric Patients with IMT\nXALKORI can cause severe gastrointestinal toxicities in pediatric and young adult\npatients with ALCL or pediatric patients with IMT [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In\npatients with ALCL (n=26), gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 100% of patients; Grade\n3 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 27% of patients and included diarrhea, nausea,\nvomiting, and stomatitis. In pediatric patients with IMT (n=14), vomiting occurred in\n93%, nausea occurred in 86%, and diarrhea occurred in 64% of patients.\nProvide standard antiemetic and antidiarrheal agents for gastrointestinal toxicities in\npediatric and young adult patients with ALCL or pediatric patients with IMT. Antiemetics\nare recommended prior to and during treatment with XALKORI to prevent nausea and\nvomiting. If patients develop Grade 3 nausea lasting 3 days or Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea or\nvomiting despite maximum medical therapy, withhold XALKORI until resolved, and then\nresume at the next lower dose level. Consider supportive care such as hydration,\nelectrolyte supplementation, and nutritional support as clinically indicated [see Dosage\nand Administration (2.6)].\n5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on its mechanism of action, XALKORI can cause fetal harm when administered to\na pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of crizotinib in\npregnant rats during organogenesis at exposures similar to those observed with the\nmaximum recommended human dose resulted in embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity. Advise\npregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus.\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment\nwith XALKORI and for 45 days following the last dose. Advise male patients with female\npartners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with XALKORI and\nfor 90 days after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Nonclinical\nToxicology (13.1)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the\nlabeling:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.\nHepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nInterstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nQT Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\nBradycardia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]\nSevere Visual Loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]\nGastrointestinal Toxicity in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients with ALCL or Pediatric\nPatients with IMT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]\nThe data in the Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to XALKORI in 1719 patients\nwith NSCLC who received XALKORI 250 mg twice daily enrolled on Studies 1 (including\nan additional 109 patients who crossed over from the control arm), 2, 3, a single-arm\ntrial (n=1063) of ALK-positive NSCLC, and an additional ALK-positive NSCLC expansion\ncohort of a dose finding study (n=154). The data also reflect exposure to XALKORI in\n121 patients ages 1 to \u226421 years with relapsed or refractory tumors, including 26\npatients with systemic ALCL and 14 pediatric patients with IMT, in a single-arm trial\n(Study ADVL0912). The data are also described for 7 adult patients with IMT treated with\nXALKORI in a single-arm trial (Study A8081013).\nALK- or ROS1-Positive Metastatic NSCLC\nThe data described below is based primarily on 343 patients with ALK-positive metastatic\nNSCLC who received XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily from 2 open-label, randomized,\nactive-controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2). The safety of XALKORI was also evaluated in 50\npatients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC from a single-arm study (Study 3).\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u226525%) of XALKORI in patients with NSCLC are\nvision disorders, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, edema, constipation, elevated\ntransaminases, fatigue, decreased appetite, upper respiratory infection, dizziness, and\nneuropathy.\nPreviously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC - Study 1 (PROFILE 1014)\nThe data in Table 9 are derived from 340 patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC\nwho had not received previous systemic treatment for advanced disease who received\ntreatment in a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial (Study 1).\nPatients in the XALKORI arm (n=171) received XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily until\ndocumented disease progression, intolerance to therapy, or the investigator determined\nthat the patient was no longer experiencing clinical benefit. A total of 169 patients in the\nchemotherapy arm received pemetrexed 500 mg/m  with cisplatin 75 mg/m  (n=91) or\ncarboplatin at a dose calculated to produce an AUC of 5 or 6 mg\u00d7min/mL (n=78).\nChemotherapy was given by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles, in\nthe absence of dose-limiting chemotherapy-related toxicities. After 6 cycles, patients\nremained on study with no additional anticancer treatment, and tumor assessments\ncontinued until documented disease progression.\nThe median duration of study treatment was 10.9 months for patients in the XALKORI\narm and 4.1 months for patients in the chemotherapy arm. Median duration of\ntreatment was 5.2 months for patients who received XALKORI after cross over from\nchemotherapy. Across the 340 patients who were treated in Study 1, the median age\nwas 53 years; 16% of patients were older than 65 years. A total of 62% of patients were\nfemale and 46% were Asian.\nSerious adverse events were reported in 34% of patients treated with XALKORI. The\nmost frequent serious adverse events reported in patients treated with XALKORI were\ndyspnea (4.1%) and pulmonary embolism (2.9%). Fatal adverse events in XALKORI-\ntreated patients occurred in 2.3% patients, consisting of septic shock, acute respiratory\nfailure, and diabetic ketoacidosis.\nDose reductions due to adverse reactions were required in 6% of XALKORI-treated\npatients.

Vision\ndisorders occurred in 92% of patients in Study 3; 90% were Grade 1 and 2% were\nGrade 2. The median duration of exposure to XALKORI was 34.4 months.\nDescription of Selected Adverse Reactions in Patients with Metastatic NSCLC\nVision disorders: Vision disorders, most commonly visual impairment, photopsia, blurred\nvision, or vitreous floaters, occurred in 63% of 1719 patients. The majority (95%) of\nthese patients had Grade 1 visual adverse reactions. There were 0.8% of patients with\nGrade 3 and 0.2% of patients with Grade 4 visual impairment. Based on the Visual\nSymptom Assessment Questionnaire (VSAQ-ALK), patients treated with XALKORI in\nStudies 1 and 2 reported a higher incidence of visual disturbances compared to patients\ntreated with chemotherapy. The onset of vision disorder generally was within the first\nweek of drug administration. The majority of patients on the XALKORI arms in Studies 1\nand 2 (>50%) reported visual disturbances which occurred at a frequency of 4\u20137 days\neach week, lasted up to 1 minute, and had mild or no impact (scores 0 to 3 out of a\nmaximum score of 10) on daily activities as captured in the VSAQ-ALK questionnaire.\nNeuropathy: Neuropathy, most commonly sensory in nature, occurred in 25% of 1719\npatients. Most events (95%) were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity.\nRenal cysts: Renal cysts were experienced by 3.0% of 1719 patients. The majority of\nrenal cysts in XALKORI-treated patients were complex. Local cystic invasion beyond the\nkidney occurred, in some cases with imaging characteristics suggestive of abscess\nformation. However, across clinical trials no renal abscesses were confirmed by\nmicrobiology tests.\nRenal toxicity: The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreased from a baseline\nmedian of 96.42 mL/min/1.73 m  (n=1681) to a median of 80.23 mL/min/1.73 m  at 2\nweeks (n=1499) in patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC who received XALKORI in\nclinical trials. No clinically relevant changes occurred in median eGFR from 12 to 104\nweeks of treatment. Median eGFR slightly increased (83.02 mL/min/1.73 m ) 4 weeks\nafter the last dose of XALKORI. Overall, 76% of patients had a decrease in eGFR to <90\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nmL/min/1.73 m , 38% had a decrease to eGFR to <60 mL/min/1.73 m , and 3.6% had a\ndecrease to eGFR to <30 mL/min/1.73 m .\nRelapsed or Refractory, Systemic ALK-Positive ALCL - Study ADVL0912\nThe safety of XALKORI was evaluated in Study ADVL0912 [see Clinical Studies 14.2],\nwhich included 26 patients with relapsed or refractory, systemic ALCL after at least one\nsystemic therapy. Eligible patients were 1 to \u226421 years of age and were required to have\nan absolute neutrophil count \u22651000/mm  (750/mm  if bone marrow was involved),\nplatelet count \u226575,000/mm  (25,000/mm  if bone marrow was involved), creatinine\nclearance \u226570ml/min/1.73m , and QTc \u2264480 msec. The study excluded patients with\nALT >2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), bilirubin \u22641.5 times ULN, and central\nnervous system tumors.\nPatients with ALCL received XALKORI 165 mg/m  or 280 mg/m  orally twice daily until\ndisease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of exposure was 5.4\nmonths (range 1.8, 82.3 months), with 46% of patients treated for at least 6 months\nand 35% of patients treated for at least 12 months.\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 35% of patients with ALCL treated with XALKORI.\nThe most frequent serious adverse reactions were neutropenia (12%) and hypotension\n(8%).\nDose interruptions and dose reductions occurred in 77% and 19% of patients with\nALCL, respectively. XALKORI was discontinued for an adverse reaction in 8% of patients.\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u226535%), excluding laboratory abnormalities, were\ndiarrhea, vomiting, nausea, vision disorder, headache, musculoskeletal pain, stomatitis,\nfatigue, decreased appetite, pyrexia, abdominal pain, cough, and pruritis.\nThe most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (\u226515%) included neutropenia,\nlymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia.

Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors. If\nconcomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors is unavoidable, reduce the XALKORI dosage\n[see Dosage and Administration (2.9)]. Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice which may\nalso increase plasma concentrations of crizotinib. Use caution with concomitant use of\nmoderate CYP3A inhibitors.\nStrong CYP3A Inducers\nConcomitant use of crizotinib with strong CYP3A inducers decreases crizotinib plasma\nconcentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may decrease the efficacy of\nXALKORI. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers.\n7.2 Effect of XALKORI on Other Drugs\nCYP3A Substrates\nConcomitant use of crizotinib increases plasma concentrations of CYP3A substrates\n[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions of\nthese substrates. Avoid concomitant use of XALKORI with CYP3A substrates where\nminimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions. If concomitant\nuse of XALKORI is unavoidable, decrease the CYP3A substrate dosage in accordance\nwith approved product labeling.\n7.3 Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval\nXALKORI can prolong the QT/QTc interval. Avoid concomitant use of XALKORI with\ndrugs that prolong the QT interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Clinical\nPharmacology (12.2)].\n7.4 Drugs That Cause Bradycardia\nXALKORI can cause bradycardia. Avoid concomitant use of XALKORI with drugs that\ncause bradycardia (e.g., beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers,\nclonidine, and digoxin) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, XALKORI can cause\nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].\nThere are no available data on the use of XALKORI in pregnant women. In animal\nreproduction studies, oral administration of crizotinib to pregnant rats during\norganogenesis at exposures similar to those expected with the maximum recommended\nhuman dose resulted in embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity (see Data). Advise pregnant\nwomen of the potential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nCrizotinib was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis to study\nthe effects on embryo-fetal development. Postimplantation loss was increased at doses\n\u226550 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.6 times the recommended human dose based on AUC)\nin rats. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats at doses up to the maternally toxic\ndose of 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.7 times the recommended human dose based\non AUC) or in rabbits at doses of up to 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.6 times the\nrecommended human dose based on AUC), though fetal body weights were reduced at\nthese doses.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere is no information regarding the presence of crizotinib or its metabolites in human\nmilk, or the effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential\nfor adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during\ntreatment with XALKORI and for 45 days after the last dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating\nXALKORI [see Use in Specific Population (8.1)].\nContraception\nXALKORI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.1)].\nFemales\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment\nwith XALKORI and for 45 days after the last dose.\nMales\nBecause of the potential for genotoxicity, advise male patients with female partners of\nreproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with XALKORI and for 90 days\nreproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with XALKORI and for 90 days\nafter the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\nInfertility\nBased on reproductive organ findings in animals, XALKORI may cause reduced fertility in\nfemales and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on\nfertility are reversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of XALKORI have been established in pediatric patients 1\nyear of age and older with relapsed or refractory, systemic ALK-positive ALCL or with\nunresectable, recurrent, or refractory ALK-positive IMT [see Adverse Reactions (6.1),\nClinical Studies (14.2, 14.3)]. The safety and effectiveness have not been established in\npediatric patients younger than 1 year of age with ALCL or with IMT, or in any pediatric\npatients with NSCLC.\nIn a study that evaluated XALKORI in combination with chemotherapy in pediatric\npatients with newly diagnosed ALCL (Study ANHL12P1; NCT01979536), 13 of 66 (20%)\npatients had a Grade 2 or higher thromboembolic event, including pulmonary embolism\nin 6%. The safety and effectiveness of XALKORI in combination with chemotherapy have\nnot been established in patients with newly diagnosed ALCL.\nJuvenile Animal Toxicity Data\nDecreased bone formation in growing long bones was observed in immature rats at 150\nmg/kg/day following once daily dosing for 28 days (approximately 5.4 times the\nrecommended human dose based on AUC). Other toxicities of potential concern to\npediatric patients have not been evaluated in juvenile animals.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the total number of patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC in clinical studies of\nXALKORI (n=1669), 16% were 65 years or older and 3.8% were 75 years or older. No\noverall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and\nyounger patients.\nClinical studies of XALKORI in patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC did not\ninclude sufficient numbers of patients age 65 years and older to determine whether they\nrespond differently from younger patients.\n8.6 Hepatic Impairment\nCrizotinib concentrations increased in patients with pre-existing moderate (any AST and\ntotal bilirubin greater than 1.5 times ULN and less than or equal to 3 times ULN) or\nsevere (any AST and total bilirubin greater than 3 times ULN) hepatic impairment [see\nClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Reduce XALKORI dosage in patients with moderate or\nsevere hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. No dose adjustment is\nrecommended in patients with pre-existing mild hepatic impairment (AST > ULN and total\nbilirubin less than or equal to 1 times ULN or any AST and total bilirubin greater than 1\ntimes ULN but less than or equal to1.5 times ULN).\n8.7 Renal Impairment\nIncreased exposure to crizotinib occurred in patients with pre-existing severe renal\nimpairment (CL  less than 30 mL/min calculated using the modified Cockcroft-Gault\nequation for adult patients and the Schwartz equation for pediatric patients) not\nrequiring dialysis, therefore reduce dosage of XALKORI in these patients [see Dosage\nand Administration (2.8), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment is\nrecommended in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (CL  30 to 89\nmL/min).\n11 DESCRIPTION\nCrizotinib is a kinase inhibitor. The molecular formula for crizotinib is C\nH\nCl FN O and\nthe molecular weight is 450.34 daltons. Crizotinib is described chemically as (R)-3-[1-\n(2,6-Dichloro-3-fluorophenyl)ethoxy]-5-[1-(piperidin-4-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]pyridin-2-\namine.\nThe chemical structure of crizotinib is shown below:\nCrizotinib is a white to pale-yellow powder with a pKa of 9.4 (piperidinium cation) and 5.6\n(pyridinium cation). The solubility of crizotinib in aqueous media decreases over the\nrange pH 1.6 to pH 8.2 from greater than 10 mg/mL to less than 0.1 mg/mL. The log of\nthe distribution coefficient (octanol/water) at pH 7.4 is 1.65.\nCapsules:\nXALKORI (crizotinib) capsules for oral administration are supplied as printed hard-shell\ncapsules containing 250 mg or 200 mg of crizotinib together with colloidal silicon\ndioxide, microcrystalline cellulose, anhydrous dibasic calcium phosphate, sodium starch\nglycolate, magnesium stearate, and hard gelatin capsule shells as inactive ingredients.\nThe pink opaque capsule shell components contain gelatin, titanium dioxide, and red iron\noxide. The white opaque capsule shell components contain gelatin and titanium dioxide.\nThe printing ink contains shellac, propylene glycol, strong ammonia solution, potassium\nhydroxide, and black iron oxide.\nOral Pellets:\nXALKORI (crizotinib) oral pellets for oral administration are supplied as 20 mg, 50 mg,\ncr\ncr\n21\n22\n2\n5\n150 mg of crizotinib contained in hard gelatin capsules. The inactive ingredients in the\nuncoated pellets are poloxamer and stearyl alcohol. The film-coating consists of\nhypromellose, glyceryl monostearate, medium chain triglycerides, polyethylene\nglycol/macrogol, sucrose, and talc.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nCrizotinib is an inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases including ALK, Hepatocyte Growth\nFactor Receptor (HGFR, c-Met), ROS1 (c-ros), and Recepteur d'Origine Nantais (RON).\nTranslocations can affect the ALK gene resulting in the expression of oncogenic fusion\nproteins. The formation of ALK fusion proteins results in activation and dysregulation of\nthe gene's expression and signaling which can contribute to increased cell proliferation\nand survival in tumors expressing these proteins. Crizotinib demonstrated\nconcentration-dependent inhibition of ALK, ROS1, and c-Met phosphorylation in cell-\nbased assays using tumor cell lines and demonstrated antitumor activity in mice bearing\ntumor xenografts that expressed echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4\n(EML4)- or nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK fusion proteins or c-Met.\nIn vitro, crizotinib induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation and ALK-mediated\nsignaling in ALCL-derived cell lines (containing NPM-ALK) at clinically achievable\nexposures. In vivo data obtained in an ALCL-derived mouse model showed complete\nregression of the tumor at a dose of 100 mg/kg once daily.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nIn an ECG substudy conducted in 52 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, the maximum\nmean QTcF (corrected QT by the Fridericia method) change from baseline was 12.3 ms\n(2-sided 90% upper CI: 19.5 ms) following administration of XALKORI 250 mg orally\ntwice daily. An exposure-QT analysis suggested a crizotinib plasma concentration-\ndependent increase in QTcF [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nFollowing XALKORI 250 mg capsules twice daily, steady-state was reached within 15\ndays with a median accumulation ratio of 4.8. Steady-state minimum concentration\n(C\n) and AUC increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner over the dose\nrange of 200 mg to 300 mg twice daily (0.8 to 1.2 times the approved recommended\ndosage).\nAbsorption\nA single crizotinib capsule dose was absorbed with median time to achieve peak\nconcentration (T\n) of 4 to 6 hours, and the mean absolute bioavailability of 43%\n(range: 32% to 66%).\nThe oral pellets had a comparable crizotinib bioavailability compared with the capsules.\nEffect of Food\nA high-fat meal, reduced AUC\n and maximum plasma concentration (C\n) of\nmin.ss\nmax\n0-INF\nmax\ncrizotinib each by 14% for the capsule formulation; reduced AUC\n and C\n of\ncrizotinib by 15% and 23%, respectively, for the pellet formulation as compared to those\nunder fasted conditions.\nDistribution\nThe geometric mean volume of distribution (V\n) of crizotinib was 1772 L following a\nsingle intravenous dose. Protein binding of crizotinib is 91% and is independent of drug\nconcentration in vitro. Crizotinib is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vitro. The\nblood-to-plasma concentration ratio is approximately 1.\nElimination\nThe mean apparent plasma terminal half-life of crizotinib was 42 hours following single\ndoses of crizotinib in patients. The mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of crizotinib was\nlower at steady-state (60 L/h) after 250 mg twice daily than after a single 250 mg oral\ndose (100 L/h).\nMetabolism\nCrizotinib is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A.\nExcretion\nFollowing administration of a single oral 250 mg dose of radiolabeled crizotinib dose to\nhealthy subjects, 63% (53% as unchanged) of the administered dose was recovered in\nfeces and 22% (2.3% as unchanged) in urine.\nSpecific Populations\nNo clinically significant difference in crizotinib pharmacokinetics were observed based on\nage, sex, or ethnicity (Asian, non-Asian). For patients <18 years of age, body weight has\na significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of crizotinib, with lower crizotinib exposures\nobserved in patients with higher body weight.\nPediatric Patients\nIn pediatric patients, crizotinib steady-state exposure increased proportionally with dose\nover the dose range of 165 mg/m  to 280 mg/m  orally twice daily. At a dosing regimen\nof 280 mg/m  (approximately 2 times the recommended adult dose), geometric mean\n(CV%) steady-state maximum plasma concentrations (C\n) of crizotinib was 621 (73%)\nng/mL and AUC\n was 6530 (34%) ng\u2219hr/mL.\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\nSteady-state mean crizotinib AUC and C\n decreased by 9% in patients with mild\nhepatic impairment (AST >ULN and total bilirubin \u22641 times ULN or any AST and total\nbilirubin >1 times ULN but \u22641.5 times ULN) compared to patients with normal hepatic\nfunction following XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily.\nSteady-state mean crizotinib AUC increased by 14% and C\n increased by 9% in\npatients with moderate hepatic impairment (any AST and total bilirubin >1.5 times ULN\nand \u22643 times ULN) following XALKORI 200 mg orally twice daily compared with patients\nwith normal hepatic function following XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily.\nMean crizotinib AUC decreased by 35% and C\n decreased by 27% in patients with\nsevere hepatic impairment (any AST and total bilirubin >3 times ULN) following XALKORI\n250 mg orally once daily compared with patients with normal hepatic function following\n0-INF\nmax\n0-INF\nmax\nss\n2\n2\n2\nmax\n0\u2013tau\nmax\nmax\nmax\nXALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Use in Specific\nPopulations (8.6)].\nPatients with Renal Impairment\nMild or moderate renal impairment (CL  of 60\u201389 ml/min or 30\u201359 ml/min, respectively,\ncalculated using the modified Cockcroft-Gault equation) has no clinically significant effect\non the exposure of crizotinib. Following a single 250 mg dose, the mean AUC\n of\ncrizotinib increased by 79% and the mean C\n increased by 34% in patients with\nsevere renal impairment (CL  <30 mL/min) who did not require dialysis compared to\nthose with normal renal function (CL  \u226590 mL/min). Similar changes in AUC\n and\nC\n were observed for the active metabolite of crizotinib [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.8), Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].\nDrug Interaction Studies\nClinical Studies\nGastric Acid Reducing Agents: No clinically significant differences in crizotinib\npharmacokinetics were observed when used concomitantly with esomeprazole, a proton\npump inhibitor.\nStrong CYP3A Inhibitors: Coadministration of a single 150 mg oral dose of crizotinib with\nketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased crizotinib AUC\n by 216% and C\nby 44% compared to crizotinib alone. Coadministration of XALKORI 250 mg orally once\ndaily with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased crizotinib steady-state AUC\nby 57% and C\n by 33% compared to crizotinib alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].\nStrong CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily with\nrifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased crizotinib steady-state AUC\n by 84%\nand C\n by 79%, compared to crizotinib alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].\nCYP3A Substrates: Coadministration of XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily for 28 days\nincreased AUC\n of oral midazolam (CYP3A substrate) 3.7-fold compared to\nmidazolam alone [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].\nIn Vitro Studies\nCYP Enzymes: Crizotinib inhibits CYP2B6 in vitro. Crizotinib does not inhibit CYP1A2,\nCYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6. Crizotinib does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6,\nCYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A.\nUDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT): Crizotinib does not inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A4,\nUGT1A6, UGT1A9 or UGT2B7.\nTransporters: Crizotinib inhibits P-gp, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, and OCT2.\nCrizotinib does not inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) B1, OATP1B3,\norganic anion transporter (OAT) 1, OAT3, or bile salt export pump transporter (BSEP).\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies with crizotinib have not been conducted.\nCrizotinib was genotoxic in an in vitro micronucleus assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary\ncr\n0\u2013INF\nmax\ncr\ncr\n0\u2013INF\nmax\n0\u2013INF\nmax\nmax\n0\u2013Tau\nmax\n0\u2013INF\ncultures, in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay, and in in vivo\nrat bone marrow micronucleus assays. Crizotinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the\nbacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay.\nNo specific studies with crizotinib have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect\non fertility; however, crizotinib is considered to have the potential to impair reproductive\nfunction and fertility in humans based on findings in repeat-dose toxicity studies in the\nrat. Findings observed in the male reproductive tract included testicular pachytene\nspermatocyte degeneration in rats given greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg/day for 28\ndays (greater than 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on AUC). Findings\nobserved in the female reproductive tract included single-cell necrosis of ovarian follicles\nof a rat given 500 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the recommended human dose\nbased on body surface area) for 3 days.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 ALK- or ROS1-Positive Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\nPreviously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC - Study 1 (PROFILE 1014;\nNCT01154140)\nThe efficacy of XALKORI for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive metastatic\nNSCLC, who had not received previous systemic treatment for advanced disease, was\ndemonstrated in a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled study (Study\n1). Patients were required to have ALK-positive NSCLC as identified by the FDA-approved\nassay, Vysis ALK Break-Apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) Probe Kit, prior to\nrandomization. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival\n(PFS) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 as\nassessed by independent radiology review (IRR) committee. Additional efficacy outcome\nmeasures included objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by IRR, DOR, and overall\nsurvival (OS). Patient-reported lung cancer symptoms were assessed at baseline and\nperiodically during treatment.\nPatients were randomized to receive XALKORI (n=172) or chemotherapy (n=171).\nRandomization was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)\nperformance status (0\u20131, 2), race (Asian, non-Asian), and brain metastases (present,\nabsent). Patients in the XALKORI arm received XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily until\ndocumented disease progression, intolerance to therapy, or the investigator determined\nthat the patient was no longer experiencing clinical benefit. Chemotherapy consisted of\npemetrexed 500 mg/m  with cisplatin 75 mg/m  or carboplatin AUC of 5 or 6\nmg\u00d7min/mL by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles. Patients in the\nchemotherapy arm were not permitted to receive maintenance chemotherapy. At the\ntime of documented disease progression, as per independent radiology review, patients\nrandomized to chemotherapy were offered XALKORI.\nThe demographic characteristics of the overall study population were 62% female,\nmedian age of 53 years, baseline ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (95%), 51% White\nand 46% Asian, 4% current smokers, 32% past smokers, and 64% never smokers. The\ndisease characteristics of the overall study population were metastatic disease in 98% of\npatients, 92% of patients' tumors were classified as adenocarcinoma histology, 27% of\npatients had brain metastases, and 7% received systemic chemotherapy as adjuvant or\nneoadjuvant therapy. At the time of the final analysis of overall survival, 84% of patients\n2\n2\nneoadjuvant therapy. At the time of the final analysis of overall survival, 84% of patients\nrandomized to the chemotherapy arm subsequently received XALKORI.\nStudy 1 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in patients treated\nwith XALKORI. There was no statistically significant difference in OS between patients\ntreated with XALKORI and patients treated with chemotherapy. Table 16 and Figure 1\nsummarize the efficacy results. Exploratory patient-reported symptom measures of\nbaseline and post-treatment dyspnea, cough, and chest pain suggested a delay in time\nto development of or worsening of dyspnea, but not cough or chest pain, in patients\ntreated with XALKORI as compared to chemotherapy. The patient-reported delay in\nonset or worsening of dyspnea may be an overestimation because patients were not\nblinded to treatment assignment.\nTable 16.

The major efficacy outcome was PFS according to RECIST version 1.1\nas assessed by IRR. Additional efficacy outcomes included ORR as assessed by IRR,\nDOR, and OS.\nPatients were randomized to receive XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily (n=173) or\nchemotherapy (n=174).

Patients in both treatment arms continued treatment until documented disease\nprogression, intolerance to therapy, or the investigator determined that the patient was\nno longer experiencing clinical benefit. Randomization was stratified by ECOG\nperformance status (0\u20131, 2), brain metastases (present, absent), and prior EGFR\ntyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment (yes, no). Patients were required to have ALK-positive\nNSCLC as identified by the FDA-approved assay, Vysis ALK Break-Apart FISH Probe Kit,\nprior to randomization.\nThe demographic characteristics of the overall study population were 56% female,\nmedian age of 50 years, baseline ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (90%), 52% White\nand 45% Asian, 4% current smokers, 33% past smokers, and 63% never smokers. The\ndisease characteristics of the overall study population were metastatic disease in at least\n95% of patients and at least 93% of patients' tumors were classified as adenocarcinoma\nhistology. At the time of the final analysis of overall survival, 89% of patients randomized\nto the chemotherapy arm subsequently received XALKORI.\nStudy 2 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the patients\ntreated with XALKORI.

The study\nexcluded patients with primary cutaneous ALCL or central nervous system involvement\nby lymphoma.\nPatients received XALKORI 280 mg/m  (20 patients) or 165 mg/m  (6 patients) orally\ntwice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were permitted to\ndiscontinue XALKORI to undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).\nOf the 26 patients evaluated, the median age was 11 years (range: 3 to 20); 69% were\nmale, 54% were White, 19% Black, 8% Asian. Patient enrollment by age category was 4\npatients from 3 to <6 years, 11 patients from 6 to <12 years, 7 patients from 12 to\n<18 years, and 4 patients from 18 to \u226421 years.\nAll patients had received multi-agent systemic therapy, 2 (8%) had received a prior HSCT\nand 4 (15%) had received at least 3 prior therapies.\nEfficacy was based on objective response rate and duration of response, as assessed\nby an independent review committee (Table 19). The median time to first response was\n3.9 weeks (range: 3.5 to 9.1 weeks).\nTable 19.

If concomitant use is unavoidable, reduce the starting dose of LORBRENA from\n100 mg orally once daily to 75 mg orally once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical\nPharmacology (12.3)].\n2.8 Dosage Modification for Severe Renal Impairment\nReduce the recommended dosage of LORBRENA for patients with severe renal\nimpairment (creatinine clearance [CL ] 15 to < 30 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-\nGault) from 100 mg to 75 mg orally once daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and\nClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nTablets:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nLORBRENA is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inducers, due to the\npotential for serious hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\n5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\ncr\n25 mg: 8 mm round, tan, immediate release, film-coated, debossed with \"Pfizer\" on\none side and \"25\" and \"LLN\" on the other side\n100 mg: 8.5 mm \u00d7 17 mm oval, lavender, immediate release, film-coated, debossed\nwith \"Pfizer\" on one side and \"LLN 100\" on the other side\n5.1 Risk of Serious Hepatotoxicity with Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A\nInducers\nSevere hepatotoxicity occurred in 10 of 12 healthy subjects receiving a single dose of\nLORBRENA with multiple daily doses of rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer. Grade 4\nalanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations occurred\nin 50% of subjects, Grade 3 ALT or AST elevations occurred in 33% and Grade 2 ALT or\nAST elevations occurred in 8%. ALT or AST elevations occurred within 3 days and\nreturned to within normal limits after a median of 15 days (7 to 34 days); the median\ntime to recovery was 18 days in subjects with Grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST elevations and 7\ndays in subjects with Grade 2 ALT or AST elevations [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].\nLORBRENA is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inducers. Discontinue\nstrong CYP3A inducers for 3 plasma half-lives of the strong CYP3A inducer prior to\ninitiating LORBRENA [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)].\n5.2 Central Nervous System Effects\nA broad spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) effects can occur in patients\nreceiving LORBRENA. These include seizures, psychotic effects and changes in cognitive\nfunction, mood (including suicidal ideation), speech, mental status, and sleep. Overall,\nCNS effects occurred in 52% of the 476 patients who received 100 mg LORBRENA once\ndaily in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Cognitive effects occurred in 28% of\nthe 476 patients; 2.9% of these events were severe (Grade 3 or 4). Mood effects\noccurred in 21% of patients; 1.7% of these events were severe. Speech effects\noccurred in 11% of patients; 0.6% of these events were severe. Psychotic effects\noccurred in 7% of patients; 0.6% of these events were severe. Mental status changes\noccurred in 1.3% of patients; 1.1% of these events were severe. Seizures occurred in\n1.9% of patients, sometimes in conjunction with other neurologic findings. Sleep effects\noccurred in 12% of patients. The median time to first onset of any CNS effect was 1.4\nmonths (1 day to 3.4 years). Overall, 2.1% of patients required permanent\ndiscontinuation of LORBRENA for a CNS effect; 10% required temporary discontinuation\nand 8% required dose reduction.\nWithhold and resume at the same dose or at a reduced dose or permanently\ndiscontinue LORBRENA based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.3 Hyperlipidemia\nIncreases in serum cholesterol and triglycerides can occur in patients receiving\nLORBRENA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Grade 3 or 4 elevations in total cholesterol\noccurred in 18% and Grade 3 or 4 elevations in triglycerides occurred in 19% of the 476\npatients who received 100 mg LORBRENA once daily. The median time to onset was 15\ndays for both hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Approximately 4% and 7%\nof patients required temporary discontinuation and 1% and 3% of patients required\ndose reduction of LORBRENA for elevations in cholesterol and in triglycerides in Study\nB7461001 and Study B7461006, respectively. Eighty-three percent of patients required\ninitiation of lipid-lowering medications, with a median time to onset of start of such\nmedications of 17 days.\nInitiate or increase the dose of lipid-lowering agents in patients with hyperlipidemia.\nMonitor serum cholesterol and triglycerides before initiating LORBRENA, 1 and 2 months\nafter initiating LORBRENA, and periodically thereafter. Withhold and resume at the same\ndose for the first occurrence; resume at the same or a reduced dose of LORBRENA for\nrecurrence based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.4 Atrioventricular Block\nPR interval prolongation and atrioventricular (AV) block can occur in patients receiving\nLORBRENA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].In 476 patients\nwho received 100 mg LORBRENA once daily and who had a baseline\nelectrocardiography (ECG), 1.9% experienced AV block and 0.2% experienced Grade 3\nAV block and underwent pacemaker placement.\nMonitor ECG prior to initiating LORBRENA and periodically thereafter. Withhold and\nresume at a reduced dose or at the same dose in patients who undergo pacemaker\nplacement. Permanently discontinue for recurrence in patients without a pacemaker [see\nDosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.5 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis\nSevere or life-threatening pulmonary adverse reactions consistent with interstitial lung\ndisease (ILD)/pneumonitis can occur with LORBRENA. ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 1.9%\nof patients who received 100 mg LORBRENA once daily, including Grade 3 or 4\nILD/pneumonitis in 0.6% of patients. Four patients (0.8%) discontinued LORBRENA for\nILD/pneumonitis.\nPromptly investigate for ILD/pneumonitis in any patient who presents with worsening of\nrespiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, and fever).\nImmediately withhold LORBRENA in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis.\nPermanently discontinue LORBRENA for treatment-related ILD/pneumonitis of any\nseverity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.6 Hypertension\nHypertension can occur in patients receiving LORBRENA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nHypertension occurred in 13% of patients who received 100 mg LORBRENA once daily,\nincluding Grade 3 or 4 in 6% of patients. The median time to onset of hypertension was\n6.4 months (1 day to 2.8 years), and 2.3% of patients temporarily discontinued\nLORBRENA for hypertension.\nControl blood pressure prior to initiation of LORBRENA. Monitor blood pressure after 2\nweeks and at least monthly thereafter during treatment with LORBRENA. Withhold and\nresume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue LORBRENA based on severity\n[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.7 Hyperglycemia\nHyperglycemia can occur in patients receiving LORBRENA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nHyperglycemia occurred in 9% of patients who received 100 mg LORBRENA, including\nGrade 3 or 4 in 3.2% of patients. The median time to onset of hyperglycemia was 4.8\nmonths (1 day to 2.9 years), and 0.8% of patients temporarily discontinued LORBRENA\nfor hyperglycemia.\nAssess fasting serum glucose prior to initiation of LORBRENA and monitor periodically\nthereafter. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue\nLORBRENA based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, LORBRENA can\ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of lorlatinib to\npregnant rats and rabbits by oral gavage during the period of organogenesis resulted in\nmalformations, increased post-implantation loss, and abortion at maternal exposures\nthat were equal to or less than the human exposure at the recommended dose of 100\nmg once daily based on area under the curve (AUC).\nAdvise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive\npotential to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception, since LORBRENA\ncan render hormonal contraceptives ineffective, during treatment with LORBRENA and\nfor at least 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of\nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LORBRENA\nand for 3 months after the final dose [see Drug Interactions (7.2), Use in Specific\nPopulations (8.1, 8.3), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe pooled safety population described in the Warnings and Precautions section reflects\nexposure to LORBRENA in 476 patients who received 100 mg LORBRENA once daily in\nStudy B7461001 (N=327) and Study B7461006 (N=149). Among 476 patients who\nreceived LORBRENA, 75% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 61% were exposed\nfor greater than 1 year.

A\npossible mechanism for hepatotoxicity is through activation of the pregnane X receptor\n(PXR) by LORBRENA and rifampin, which are both PXR agonists.\nLORBRENA is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inducers [see\nContraindication (4)]. Discontinue strong CYP3A inducers for 3 plasma half-lives of the\nstrong CYP3A inducer prior to initiating LORBRENA [see Dosage and Administration\n(2.3)].\nModerate CYP3A Inducers\nConcomitant use of LORBRENA with a moderate CYP3A inducer decreased lorlatinib\nplasma concentrations, which may decrease the efficacy of LORBRENA [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers with\nLORBRENA. If concomitant use is unavoidable, increase the LORBRENA dose [see\nDosage and Administration (2.4)].\nStrong CYP3A Inhibitors\nConcomitant use with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increased lorlatinib plasma\nconcentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the incidence and\nseverity of adverse reactions of LORBRENA. Avoid concomitant use of LORBRENA with\na strong CYP3A inhibitor. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, reduce the LORBRENA\ndosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\nFluconazole\nConcomitant use of LORBRENA with fluconazole may increase lorlatinib plasma\nconcentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the incidence and\nseverity of adverse reactions of LORBRENA. Avoid concomitant use of LORBRENA with\nfluconazole. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, reduce the LORBRENA dosage [see\nDosage and Administration (2.7)].\n7.2 Effect of LORBRENA on Other Drugs\nCertain CYP3A Substrates\nLORBRENA is a moderate CYP3A inducer. Concomitant use of LORBRENA decreases the\nconcentration of CYP3A substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may\nreduce the efficacy of these substrates. Avoid concomitant use of LORBRENA with\ncertain CYP3A substrates, for which minimal concentration changes may lead to serious\ntherapeutic failures. If concomitant use is unavoidable, increase the CYP3A substrate\ndosage in accordance with approved product labeling.\nCertain P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Substrates\nLORBRENA is a moderate P-gp inducer. Concomitant use of LORBRENA decreases the\nconcentration of P-gp substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may reduce\nthe efficacy of these substrates. Avoid concomitant use of LORBRENA with certain P-gp\nsubstrates for which minimal concentration changes may lead to serious therapeutic\nfailures. If concomitant use is unavoidable, increase the P-gp substrate dosage in\naccordance with approved product labeling.\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.1)], LORBRENA can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a\npregnant woman. There are no available data on LORBRENA use in pregnant women.\nAdministration of lorlatinib to pregnant rats and rabbits by oral gavage during the period\nof organogenesis resulted in malformations, increased post-implantation loss, and\nabortion at maternal exposures that were equal to or less than the human exposure at\nthe recommended dose of 100 mg once daily based on AUC (see Data). Advise a\npregnant woman of the potential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nPreliminary embryo-fetal development studies investigating the administration of\nlorlatinib during the period of organogenesis were conducted in rats and rabbits. In\nrabbits, lorlatinib administration resulted in abortion and total loss of pregnancy at doses\nof 15 mg/kg (approximately 3 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of\n100 mg) or greater. At a dose of 4 mg/kg (approximately 0.6 times the human exposure\nat the recommended dose of 100 mg) toxicities included increased post-implantation\nloss and malformations including rotated limbs, malformed kidneys, domed head, high\narched palate, and dilation of the cerebral ventricles. In rats, administration of lorlatinib\nresulted in total loss of pregnancy at doses of 4 mg/kg (approximately 5 times the\nhuman exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg) or greater. At a dose of 1\nmg/kg (approximately equal to the human exposure at the recommended dose of 100\nmg) there was increased post-implantation loss, decreased fetal body weight, and\nmalformations including gastroschisis, rotated limbs, supernumerary digits, and vessel\nabnormalities.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of lorlatinib or its metabolites in either human or\nanimal milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Because of the\npotential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, instruct women not to\nbreastfeed during treatment with LORBRENA and for 7 days after the final dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating LORBRENA\n[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nContraception\nLORBRENA can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see\nUse in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nFemales\nAdvise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal\ncontraception during treatment with LORBRENA and for at least 6 months after the final\ndose. Advise females of reproductive potential to use a non-hormonal method of\ncontraception, because LORBRENA can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective [see\nDrug Interactions (7.2)].\nMales\nBased on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive\npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with LORBRENA and for at\nleast 3 months after the final dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\nInfertility\nMales\nBased on findings from animal studies, LORBRENA may transiently impair male fertility\n[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of LORBRENA in pediatric patients have not been\nestablished.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the patients in Study B7461001 (N=295) and Study B7461006 (N=149) who\nreceived 100 mg LORBRENA orally once daily, 18% and 40% of patients, respectively,\nwere aged 65 years or older. No clinically important differences in safety or efficacy\nwere observed between patients aged 65 years or older and younger patients.\n8.6 Hepatic Impairment\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total\nbilirubin \u2264 upper limit of normal [ULN] with AST > ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 \u00d7 ULN\nwith any AST). The recommended dose of LORBRENA has not been established for\npatients with moderate (total bilirubin \u2265 1.5 to 3.0 \u00d7 ULN with any AST) or severe (total\nbilirubin > 3.0 \u00d7 ULN with any AST) hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology\n(12.3)].\n8.7 Renal Impairment\nReduce the dose when administering LORBRENA to patients with severe (CL  15 to <30\nmL/min, estimated by Cockcroft Gault) renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration\n(2.8) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate (CL  30 to 89\nmL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault) renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology\n(12.3)].\n11 DESCRIPTION\ncr\ncr\nLORBRENA (lorlatinib) is a kinase inhibitor for oral administration. The molecular formula\nis C\nH\nFN O  (anhydrous form) and the molecular weight is 406.41 Daltons. The\nchemical name is (10R)-7-amino-12-fluoro-2,10,16-trimethyl-15-oxo-10,15,16,17-\ntetrahydro-2H-4,8-methenopyrazolo[4,3-h][2,5,11] benzoxadiazacyclotetradecine-3-\ncarbonitrile. The chemical structure is shown below:\nLorlatinib is a white to off-white powder with a pKa of 4.92. The solubility of lorlatinib in\naqueous media decreases over the range pH 2.55 to pH 8.02 from 32.38 mg/mL to 0.17\nmg/mL. The log of the distribution coefficient (octanol/water) at pH 9 is 2.45.\nLORBRENA is supplied as tablets containing 25 mg or 100 mg of lorlatinib with the\nfollowing inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, dibasic calcium phosphate\nanhydrous, sodium starch glycolate, and magnesium stearate. The film-coating contains\nhydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) 2910/hypromellose, lactose monohydrate,\nmacrogol/polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, triacetin, titanium dioxide, ferrosoferric\noxide/black iron oxide, and iron oxide red.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nLorlatinib is a kinase inhibitor with in vitro activity against ALK and ROS1 as well as TYK1,\nFER, FPS, TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, FAK, FAK2, and ACK. Lorlatinib demonstrated in vitro\nactivity against multiple mutant forms of the ALK enzyme, including some mutations\ndetected in tumors at the time of disease progression on crizotinib and other ALK\ninhibitors.\nIn mice subcutaneously implanted with tumors harboring EML4 fusions with either ALK\nvariant 1 or ALK mutations, including the G1202R and I1171T mutations detected in\ntumors at the time of disease progression on ALK inhibitors, administration of lorlatinib\nresulted in antitumor activity. Lorlatinib also demonstrated anti-tumor activity and\nprolonged survival in mice implanted intracranially with EML4-ALK-driven tumor cell lines.\nThe overall antitumor activity of lorlatinib in in vivo models was dose-dependent and\ncorrelated with inhibition of ALK phosphorylation.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nExposure-response relationships for Grade 3 or 4 hypercholesterolemia and for any\nGrade 3 or 4 adverse reaction were observed at steady-state exposures achieved at the\n21\n19\n6\n2\nrecommended dosage, with higher probability of the occurrence of adverse reactions\nwith increasing lorlatinib exposure.\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nIn 295 patients who received LORBRENA at the recommended dosage of 100 mg once\ndaily and had an ECG measurement in Study B7461001, the maximum mean change\nfrom baseline for PR interval was 16.4 ms (2-sided 90% upper confidence interval [CI]\n19.4 ms). Among the 284 patients with PR interval <200 ms at baseline, 14% had PR\ninterval prolongation \u2265200 ms after starting LORBRENA. The prolongation of PR interval\noccurred in a concentration-dependent manner. Atrioventricular block occurred in 1% of\npatients.\nIn 275 patients who received LORBRENA at the recommended dosage in the activity-\nestimating portion of Study B7461001, no large mean increases from baseline in the\nQTcF interval (i.e., >20 ms) were detected.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nSteady-state lorlatinib maximum plasma concentration (C\n) increases proportionally\nand AUC increased slightly less than proportionally over the dose range of 10 mg to 200\nmg orally once daily (0.1 to 2 times the recommended dosage). At the recommended\ndosage, the mean (coefficient of variation [CV] %) C\n was 577 ng/mL (42%) and the\nAUC\n was 5650 ng\u2219h/mL (39%) in patients with cancer. Lorlatinib oral clearance\nincreased at steady-state compared to single dose, indicating autoinduction.\nAbsorption\nThe median lorlatinib T\n was 1.2 hours (0.5 to 4 hours) following a single oral 100 mg\ndose and 2 hours (0.5 to 23 hours) following 100 mg orally once daily at steady-state.\nThe mean absolute bioavailability is 81% (90% CI 75.7%, 86.2%) after oral administration\ncompared to intravenous administration.\nEffect of Food\nThere was no clinically significant effect on lorlatinib pharmacokinetics following\nadministration of LORBRENA with a high fat, high calorie meal (approximately 1000\ncalories with 150 calories from protein, 250 calories from carbohydrate, and 500 to 600\ncalories from fat).\nDistribution\nLorlatinib was 66% bound to plasma proteins at a concentration of 2.4 \u00b5M. The blood-to-\nplasma ratio was 0.99, in vitro. The mean (CV%) steady-state volume of distribution\n(V\n) was 305 L (28%) following a single intravenous dose.\nElimination\nThe mean plasma half-life (t ) of lorlatinib was 24 hours (40%) after a single oral 100 mg\ndose of LORBRENA. The mean oral clearance (CL/F) was 11 L/h (35%) following a single\noral 100 mg dose and increased to 18 L/h (39%) at steady-state, suggesting\nautoinduction.\nMetabolism\nLorlatinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and UGT1A4, with minor contribution from\nmax\nmax\n0\u201324h\nmax\nss\n\u00bd\nCYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP3A5, and UGT1A3, in vitro.\nIn plasma, a benzoic acid metabolite (M8) of lorlatinib resulting from the oxidative\ncleavage of the amide and aromatic ether bonds of lorlatinib accounted for 21% of the\ncirculating radioactivity. The oxidative cleavage metabolite, M8, is pharmacologically\ninactive.\nExcretion\nFollowing a single oral 100 mg dose of radiolabeled lorlatinib, 48% of the radioactivity\nwas recovered in urine (<1% as unchanged) and 41% in feces (about 9% as\nunchanged).\nSpecific Populations\nNo clinically significant differences in lorlatinib pharmacokinetics were observed based on\nage (19 to 85 years), sex, race/ethnicity, body weight, mild to moderate renal\nimpairment (CL  30 to 89 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault), mild hepatic\nimpairment (total bilirubin \u2264 ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin > 1 to 1.5 \u00d7 ULN and\nany AST), or metabolizer phenotypes for CYP3A5 and CYP2C19. The effect of moderate\nto severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 ULN with any AST) on lorlatinib\npharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].\nPatients with Severe Renal Impairment\nFollowing administration of a single oral 100 mg dose of LORBRENA, lorlatinib AUC\nincreased by 42% in subjects with severe renal impairment (CL  15 to <30 mL/min,\nestimated by Cockcroft-Gault) compared to subjects with normal renal function (CL  \u2265\n90 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault). The pharmacokinetics of lorlatinib have not\nbeen studied in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis.\nDrug Interaction Studies\nClinical Studies and Model-Informed Approaches\nEffect of Strong CYP3A Inducers on Lorlatinib: Rifampin (a strong CYP3A inducer that\nalso activates PXR) 600 mg once daily for 8 days (Days 1 to 8) coadministered with a\nsingle oral 100 mg dose of LORBRENA on Day 8 reduced the mean lorlatinib AUC\n by\n85% and C\n by 76%. Grade 2 to 4 increases in ALT or AST occurred within 3 days.\nGrade 4 ALT or AST elevations occurred in 50%, Grade 3 ALT or AST elevations in 33%,\nand Grade 2 ALT or AST elevations occurred in 8% of subjects. ALT and AST returned to\nwithin normal limits within 7 to 34 days (median 15 days) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].\nEffect of Moderate CYP3A Inducers on Lorlatinib: Modafinil (a moderate CYP3A inducer)\ndecreased AUC\n by 23% and decreased C\n by 22% of a single oral 100 mg dose of\nLORBRENA [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].\nEffect of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors on Lorlatinib: Itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor)\nincreased AUC\n by 42% and increased C\n by 24% of a single oral 100 mg dose of\nLORBRENA [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].\nEffect of Fluconazole on Lorlatinib: Fluconazole is predicted to increase steady-state\nAUC\n and C\n of lorlatinib by 59%, and 28%, respectively, following concomitant oral\nadministration of 100 mg of LORBRENA once daily and 200 mg fluconazole once daily\n[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].\nEffect of Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors on Lorlatinib: No clinically significant effect on\ncr\ninf\ncr\ncr\ninf\nmax\ninf\nmax\ninf\nmax\ntau\nmax\nsteady-state lorlatinib pharmacokinetics is predicted when used concomitantly with\nverapamil or erythromycin.\nEffect of Lorlatinib on CYP3A Substrates: LORBRENA 150 mg orally once daily for 15\ndays decreased AUC\n by 64% and C\n by 50% of a single oral 2 mg dose of\nmidazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].\nEffect of Lorlatinib on CYP2B6 Substrates: LORBRENA 100 mg orally once daily for 15\ndays decreased AUC\n by 25% and C\n by 27% of a single oral 100 mg dose of\nbupropion (a sensitive CYP2B6 substrate).\nEffect of Lorlatinib on CYP2C9 Substrates: LORBRENA 100 mg orally once daily for 15\ndays decreased AUC\n by 43% and C\n by 15% of a single oral 100 mg dose of\ntolbutamide (a sensitive CYP2C9 substrate).\nEffect of Lorlatinib on UGT1A Substrates: LORBRENA 100 mg orally once daily for 15\ndays decreased AUC\n by 45% and C\n by 28% of a single oral 100 mg dose of\nacetaminophen (a UGT1A substrate).\nEffect of Lorlatinib on P-gp Substrates: LORBRENA 100 mg orally once daily for 15 days\ndecreased AUC\n by 67% and C\n by 63% of a single oral 60 mg dose of fexofenadine\n(a P-gp substrate) [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].\nEffect of Acid-Reducing Agents on Lorlatinib: Concomitant use of a proton pump\ninhibitor, rabeprazole, did not have a clinically significant effect on lorlatinib\npharmacokinetics.\nIn Vitro Studies\nEffect of Lorlatinib on CYP Enzymes: Lorlatinib is a time-dependent inhibitor as well as an\ninducer of CYP3A and activates PXR, with the net effect in vivo being induction. Lorlatinib\ninduces CYP2B6 and activates the human constitutive androstane receptor (CAR).\nLorlatinib and the major circulating metabolite, M8, do not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6,\nCYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6. M8 does not inhibit CYP3A.\nM8 does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A.\nEffects of Lorlatinib on UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT): Lorlatinib and M8 do not\ninhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, or UGT2B15.\nEffect of Lorlatinib on Transporter Systems: Lorlatinib is an inhibitor of P-gp and\nactivates PXR (potential to induce P-gp), with the net effect in vivo being induction.\nLorlatinib inhibits organic cation transporter (OCT)1, organic anion transporter (OAT)3,\nmultidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)1, and intestinal breast cancer resistance protein\n(BCRP). Lorlatinib does not inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1,\nOATP1B3, OAT1, OCT2, MATE2K, or systemic BCRP. M8 does not inhibit P-gp, BCRP,\nOATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, or MATE2K.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with lorlatinib. Lorlatinib was aneugenic\nin an in vitro assay in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells and positive for micronuclei\nformation in vivo in the bone marrow of rats. Lorlatinib was not mutagenic in an in vitro\ninf\nmax\ninf\nmax\ninf\nmax\ninf\nmax\ninf\nmax\nbacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay.\nDedicated fertility studies were not conducted with lorlatinib. Findings in male\nreproductive organs occurred in repeat-dose toxicity studies and included lower\ntesticular, epididymal, and prostate weights; testicular tubular degeneration/atrophy;\nprostatic atrophy; and/or epididymal inflammation at 15 mg/kg/day and 7 mg/kg/day in\nrats and dogs, respectively (approximately 8 and 2 times, respectively, the human\nexposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg based on AUC). The effects on male\nreproductive organs were reversible.\n13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nDistended abdomen, skin rash, and increased cholesterol and triglycerides occurred in\nanimals. These findings were accompanied by hyperplasia and dilation of the bile ducts in\nthe liver and acinar atrophy of the pancreas in rats at 15 mg/kg/day and in dogs at 2\nmg/kg/day (approximately 8 and 0.5 times, respectively, the human exposure at the\nrecommended dose of 100 mg based on AUC). All effects were reversible within the\nrecovery period.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nPreviously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC (CROWN Study)\nThe efficacy of LORBRENA for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who\nhad not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease was established in an\nopen-label, randomized, active-controlled, multicenter study (Study B7461006;\nNCT03052608). Patients were required to have an ECOG performance status of 0\u20132 and\nALK-positive NSCLC as identified by the VENTANA ALK (D5F3) CDx assay. Neurologically\nstable patients with treated or untreated asymptomatic CNS metastases, including\nleptomeningeal metastases, were eligible. Patients were required to have finished\nradiation therapy, at least 2 weeks (for stereotactic or partial radiation) or 4 weeks (for\nwhole brain irradiation) prior to randomization. Patients with severe acute or chronic\npsychiatric conditions, including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation\nor behavior, were excluded.\nPatients were randomized 1:1 to receive LORBRENA 100 mg orally once daily or\ncrizotinib 250 mg orally twice daily. Randomization was stratified by ethnic origin (Asian\nvs. non-Asian) and the presence or absence of CNS metastases at baseline. Treatment\non both arms was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The\nmajor efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by\nBlinded Independent Central Review (BICR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in\nSolid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (v1.1). Additional efficacy outcome measures were\noverall survival (OS) and tumor assessment related data by BICR, including overall\nresponse rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR). In patients with measurable CNS\nmetastases at baseline, additional outcome measures were intracranial overall response\nrate (IC-ORR) and intracranial duration of response (IC-DOR) by BICR.\nA total of 296 patients were randomized to LORBRENA (n=149) or crizotinib (n=147).\nThe demographic characteristics of the overall study population were: median age 59\nyears (range: 26 to 90 years), age \u226565 years (35%), 59% female, 49% White, 44%\nAsian, and 0.3% Black. The ECOG performance status at baseline was 0 or 1 in 96% of\npatients. The majority of patients had adenocarcinoma (95%) and never smoked (59%).\nCNS metastases were present in 26% (n=78) of patients: of these, 30 patients had\nmeasurable CNS lesions.\nEfficacy results from Study B7461006 as assessed by BICR are summarized in Table 6\nand Figure 1. Results demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS for the LORBRENA\narm over the crizotinib arm.

Patients included in this subgroup\nwere required to have metastatic disease with at least 1 measurable target lesion\naccording to RECIST v1.1, ECOG performance status of 0 to 2, and documented ALK\nrearrangement in tumor tissue as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization\n(FISH) assay or by Immunohistochemistry (IHC), and received LORBRENA 100 mg orally\nonce daily. Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases, including patients with stable or\ndecreasing steroid use within 2 weeks prior to study entry, were eligible. Patients with\nsevere, acute, or chronic psychiatric conditions including suicidal ideation or behavior\nwere excluded. In addition, for patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC, the extent\nand type of prior treatment was specified for each individual cohort (see Table 8). The\nmajor efficacy outcome measures were ORR and intracranial ORR, according to RECIST\nv1.1, as assessed by Independent Central Review (ICR) committee. Data were pooled\nacross all subgroups listed in Table 8. Additional efficacy outcome measures included\nDOR, and intracranial DOR.\nA total of 215 patients were enrolled across the subgroups in Table 8. The distribution of\npatients by type and extent of prior therapy is provided in Table 8. The demographic\ncharacteristics across all 215 patients were: 59% female, 51% White, 34% Asian, and\nthe median age was 53 years (29 to 85 years) with 18% of patients \u226565 years. The\nECOG performance status at baseline was 0 or 1 in 96% of patients. All patients had\nmetastatic disease and 95% had adenocarcinoma.

In the ALINA study, hepatotoxicity occurred in 61% of patients\ntreated with ALECENSA and the incidence of Grade \u2265 3 hepatotoxicity was 4.7%. The\nmajority (72% of 136 patients) of elevated transaminases occurred during the first 3\nmonths of treatment. Treatment discontinuation due to hepatotoxicity occurred in 3.6%\nof patients who received ALECENSA in the pooled safety population and 1.6% of patients\ntreated in the ALINA study.\nIn the pooled safety population, concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than or\nequal to 3 times the ULN and total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times the ULN,\nwith normal alkaline phosphatase, occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with\nALECENSA. Three patients with Grades 3\u20134 AST/ALT elevations had drug-induced liver\ninjury (documented by liver biopsy in two cases).\nMonitor liver function tests including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin every 2 weeks during\nthe first 3 months of treatment, then once a month and as clinically indicated, with more\nfrequent testing in patients who develop transaminase and bilirubin elevations. Based on\nthe severity of the adverse drug reaction, withhold ALECENSA and resume at a reduced\ndose or permanently discontinue ALECENSA as described in Table 3 [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.4)].\n5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis\nILD/pneumonitis occurred in patients treated with ALECENSA.\nIn the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], ILD/pneumonitis occurred\nin 1.3% of patients treated with ALECENSA with 0.4% of patients experiencing Grade 3\nILD/pneumonitis.\nFive patients (0.9%) in the pooled safety population discontinued ALECENSA due to\nILD/pneumonitis. The median time-to-onset of Grade 3 or higher ILD/pneumonitis was\n2.1 months (range: 0.6 months to 3.6 months).\nPromptly investigate for ILD/pneumonitis in any patient who presents with worsening of\nrespiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, and fever).\nImmediately withhold ALECENSA treatment in patients diagnosed with ILD/pneumonitis\nand permanently discontinue ALECENSA if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis\nhave been identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Adverse Reactions (6)].\n5.3 Renal Impairment\nRenal impairment, including fatal cases, occurred in patients treated with ALECENSA.\nIn the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], renal impairment occurred\nin 12% of patients treated with ALECENSA, including Grade \u2265 3 in 1.7% of patients, of\nwhich 0.4% were fatal events. The median time to Grade \u2265 3 renal impairment was 3.7\nmonths (range 0.5 to 31.8 months). Dosage modifications for renal impairment were\nrequired in 2.4% of patients.\nPermanently discontinue ALECENSA for Grade 4 renal toxicity. Withhold ALECENSA for\nGrade 3 renal toxicity until recovery to less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN, then resume\nat reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\n5.4 Bradycardia\nSymptomatic bradycardia occurred in patients treated with ALECENSA.\nIn the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], bradycardia occurred in\n11% of patients treated with ALECENSA. Twenty percent of 521 patients treated with\nALECENSA, for whom serial electrocardiograms (ECGs) were available, had post-dose\nheart rates of less than 50 beats per minute (bpm).\nMonitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. For asymptomatic bradycardia dose\nmodification is not required. For symptomatic bradycardia that is not life-threatening,\nwithhold ALECENSA until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate \u2265 60\nbpm and evaluate concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia, as well as anti-\nhypertensive medications. If bradycardia is attributable to a concomitant medication,\nresume ALECENSA at a reduced dose (see Table 2) upon recovery to asymptomatic\nbradycardia or to a heart rate of \u2265 60 bpm, with frequent monitoring as clinically\nindicated.\nPermanently discontinue ALECENSA in cases of life-threatening bradycardia if no\ncontributing concomitant medication is identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\nPermanently discontinue ALECENSA for recurrence of life-threatening bradycardia.\n5.5 Severe Myalgia and Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation\nSevere myalgia and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation occurred in patients treated\nwith ALECENSA.\nIn the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], myalgia (including muscle-\nand musculoskeletal-related reactions) occurred in 31% of patients treated with\nALECENSA, including Grade \u2265 3 in 0.8% of patients. Dosage modifications for myalgia\nevents were required in 2.1% of patients.\nIn the pooled safety population, of the 491 patients with CPK laboratory data available,\nelevated CPK occurred in 56% of patients treated with ALECENSA, including 6% Grade \u2265\n3. The median time to Grade \u2265 3 CPK elevation was 15 days (interquartile range - 15 \u2013\n337 days). Dosage modifications for elevation of CPK occurred in 5% of patients.\nIn the ALINA study, elevated CPK occurred in 77% of 128 patients with CPK laboratory\ndata, including 6% Grade \u2265 3 elevations.\nAdvise patients to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness.\nAssess CPK levels every 2 weeks for the first month of treatment and as clinically\nindicated in patients reporting symptoms. Based on the severity of the CPK elevation,\nwithhold ALECENSA, then resume or reduce dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\n5.6 Hemolytic Anemia\nHemolytic anemia occurred in patients treated with ALECENSA.\nHemolytic anemia was initially reported with ALECENSA in the postmarketing setting,\nincluding cases associated with a negative direct antiglobulin test (DAT) result.\nAssessments for the determination of hemolytic anemia were subsequently collected in\nthe ALINA study, where hemolytic anemia was observed in 3.1% of patients treated with\nALECENSA. If hemolytic anemia is suspected, withhold ALECENSA and initiate\nappropriate laboratory testing. If hemolytic anemia is confirmed, consider resuming at a\nreduced dose upon resolution or permanently discontinue ALECENSA [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.4)].\n5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, ALECENSA can\ncause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Oral administration of alectinib\nto pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal\ntoxicity and abortion at maternally toxic doses with exposures approximately 2.7-fold\nthose observed in humans with alectinib 600 mg twice daily. Advise pregnant women\nand females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus.\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment\nwith ALECENSA and for 5 weeks following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations\n(8.1 and 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the\nlabel:\nHepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nInterstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nRenal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\nBradycardia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]\nSevere Myalgia and Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation [see Warnings and\nPrecautions (5.5)]\nHemolytic Anemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]\nEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect\nexposure to ALECENSA as a single agent at 600 mg orally twice daily in 533 patients in\nStudies NP28761, NP28673, ALEX and ALINA [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Among 533\npatients who received ALECENSA, 75% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 64%\nwere exposed for greater than one year. In this pooled safety population, the most\ncommon (\u2265 20%) adverse reactions were hepatotoxicity (41%), constipation (39%),\nfatigue (36%), myalgia (31%), edema (29%), rash (23%) and cough (21%). The most\ncommon (\u2265 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were increased CPK (6%),\ndecreased hemoglobin (4.4%), increased ALT (4.2%), increased bilirubin (4.0%) and\nincreased AST (3.4%).\nAdjuvant Treatment of Resected ALK-Positive NSCLC\nThe safety of ALECENSA was evaluated in ALINA, a multi-center, open-label, randomized\ntrial for the adjuvant treatment of patients with resected ALK-positive NSCLC [see Clinical\nStudies (14.1)].

The median duration of exposure to ALECENSA was 9.3 months. One\nhundred sixty-nine patients (67%) were exposed to ALECENSA for more than 6 months,\nand 100 patients (40%) for more than one year. The population characteristics were:\nmedian age 53 years, age less than 65 (86%), female (55%), White (74%), Asian (18%),\nNSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (96%), never or former smoker (98%), ECOG\nPerformance Status (PS) 0 or 1 (91%), and prior chemotherapy treatment (78%).\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 19% of patients; the most frequently reported\nserious adverse reactions were pulmonary embolism (1.2%), dyspnea (1.2%), and\nhyperbilirubinemia (1.2%).

There are no available data on ALECENSA use in pregnant women.\nAdministration of alectinib to pregnant rats and rabbits by oral gavage during the period\nof organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity and abortion at maternally toxic doses\nwith exposures approximately 2.7-fold those observed in humans treated with alectinib\nat 600 mg twice daily (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nIn a preliminary rabbit embryo-fetal study, administration of alectinib by oral gavage\nduring the period of organogenesis resulted in abortion or complete embryo-fetal\nmortality at a maternally toxic dose of 27 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.9-fold the\nestimated area under the curve (AUC\n) in humans treated with alectinib 600 mg\ntwice daily) in three of six pregnant rabbits. The remaining three pregnant rabbits in this\ngroup had few live fetuses, decreased fetal and placental weights, and retroesophageal\nsubclavian artery. In a rat preliminary embryo-fetal development study, administration of\nalectinib during organogenesis resulted in complete litter loss in all pregnant rats at 27\nmg/kg/day (approximately 4.5-fold the estimated AUC\n in humans treated with\nalectinib 600 mg twice daily). Doses greater than or equal to 9 mg/kg/day (approximately\n2.7-fold the estimated human AUC\n in humans treated with alectinib 600 mg twice\ndaily), resulted in maternal toxicity as well as developmental toxicities including\ndecreased fetal weight, dilated ureter, thymic cord, small ventricle and thin ventricle wall,\nand reduced number of sacral and caudal vertebrae.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of alectinib or its metabolites in human milk, the\neffects of alectinib on the breastfed child, or its effects on milk production. Because of\nthe potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children from alectinib, advise a\nlactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with ALECENSA and for 1 week\nafter the last dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nALECENSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.1)].\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating ALECENSA\n[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nContraception\n0-24h,ss\n0-24h,ss\n0-24h,ss\nFemales\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment\nwith ALECENSA and for 5 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations\n(8.1)].\nMales\nBased on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive\npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALECENSA and for 3\nmonths following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of ALECENSA in pediatric patients have not been\nestablished.\nAnimal Data\nJuvenile animal studies have not been conducted using alectinib. In general toxicology\nstudies, treatment of rats with doses of alectinib resulting in exposures greater than or\nequal to approximately 4.5-fold those in humans treated with alectinib at 600 mg twice\ndaily resulted in changes in the growing teeth and bones. Findings in teeth included\ndiscoloration and changes in tooth size along with histopathological disarrangement of\nthe ameloblast and odontoblast layers. There were also decreases in the trabecular bone\nand increased osteoclast activity in the femur and sternum.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nNineteen percent of the 533 patients studied in NP28761, NP28673, ALEX and ALINA\nwere 65 years of age and older (3.2% were 75 years of age and older). No overall\ndifferences in effectiveness were observed based on age. Exploratory analysis suggests\na higher incidence of serious adverse events (38% vs 25%), more frequent adverse\nevents leading to treatment discontinuations (18% vs 6%) and dose modifications (48%\nvs 35%) in patients 65 years or older as compared to those younger than 65 years.\n8.6 Renal Impairment\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal\nimpairment. The safety of ALECENSA in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine\nclearance less than 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease has not been studied [see\nClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n8.7 Hepatic Impairment\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate\n(Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. Increased exposure of alectinib occurred in patients\nwith severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). The recommended dose of ALECENSA in\npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) is 450 mg orally twice daily [see\nDosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n10 OVERDOSAGE\nNo experience with overdose is available. There is no specific antidote for overdose with\nALECENSA. Alectinib and its major active metabolite M4 are > 99% bound to plasma\nproteins; therefore, hemodialysis is likely to be ineffective in the treatment of overdose.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nALECENSA (alectinib) is a kinase inhibitor for oral administration. The molecular formula\nfor alectinib is C\nH\nN O  \u2219 HCl. The molecular weight is 482.62 g/mol (free base form)\nand 519.08 g/mol (hydrochloride salt). Alectinib is described chemically as 9-ethyl-6, 6-\ndimethyl-8-[4-(morpholin-4-yl)piperidin-1-yl]-11-oxo-6, 11-dihydro-5H-\nbenzo[b]carbazole-3-carbonitrile hydrochloride. The chemical structure of alectinib is\nshown below:\nAlectinib HCl is a white to yellow white powder or powder with lumps with a pKa of 7.05\n(base).\nALECENSA is supplied as hard capsules containing 150 mg of alectinib (equivalent to\n161.33 mg alectinib HCl) and the following inactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate,\nhydroxypropylcellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium stearate, and\ncarboxymethylcellulose calcium. The capsule shell contains hypromellose, carrageenan,\npotassium chloride, titanium dioxide, corn starch, and carnauba wax. The printing ink\ncontains red iron oxide (E172), yellow iron oxide (E172), FD&C Blue No. 2 aluminum lake\n(E132), carnauba wax, white shellac, and glyceryl monooleate.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nAlectinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets ALK and RET. In nonclinical studies,\nalectinib inhibited ALK phosphorylation and ALK-mediated activation of the downstream\nsignaling proteins STAT3 and AKT, and decreased tumor cell viability in multiple cell lines\nharboring ALK fusions, amplifications, or activating mutations. The major active\nmetabolite of alectinib, M4, showed similar in vitro potency and activity.\nAlectinib and M4 demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against multiple mutant forms\nof the ALK enzyme, including some mutations identified in NSCLC tumors in patients who\nhave progressed on crizotinib.\nIn mouse models implanted with tumors carrying ALK fusions, administration of alectinib\nresulted in antitumor activity and prolonged survival, including in mouse models\n30\n34\n4\n2\nimplanted intracranially with ALK-driven tumor cell lines.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nThe ability of alectinib to prolong the QT interval was assessed in 221 patients\nadministered ALECENSA 600 mg twice daily in clinical studies. ALECENSA did not prolong\nthe QTc (QT corrected for heart rate) interval to any clinically relevant extent. One\npatient had a maximum post-baseline QTcF value of greater than 500 msec, and one\npatient had a maximum QTcF change from baseline of greater than 60 msec.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of alectinib and its major active metabolite M4 have been\ncharacterized in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC and healthy subjects.\nIn patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, the geometric mean (coefficient of variation %)\nsteady-state maximal concentration (C\n) for alectinib was 665 ng/mL (44%) and for\nM4 was 246 ng/mL (45%) with peak to trough concentration ratio of 1.2. The geometric\nmean steady-state area under the curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC\n) for alectinib\nwas 7,430 ng*h/mL (46%) and for M4 was 2,810 ng*h/mL (46%). Alectinib exposure is\ndose proportional across the dose range of 460 mg to 900 mg (i.e., 0.75 to 1.5 times\nthe approved recommended dosage) under fed conditions. Alectinib and M4 reached\nsteady-state concentrations by day 7. The geometric mean accumulation was\napproximately 6-fold for both alectinib and M4.\nAbsorption\nAlectinib reached maximal concentrations at 4 hours following administration of\nALECENSA 600 mg twice daily under fed conditions in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC.\nThe absolute bioavailability of alectinib was 37% (90% CI: 34%, 40%) under fed\nconditions.\nA high-fat, high-calorie meal increased the combined exposure (AUC\n) of alectinib plus\nM4 by 3.1-fold (90% CI: 2.7, 3.6) following oral administration of a single 600 mg dose of\nALECENSA.\nDistribution\nThe apparent volume of distribution is 4,016 L for alectinib and 10,093 L for M4.\nAlectinib and M4 are bound to human plasma proteins greater than 99%, independent of\ndrug concentration.\nAlectinib concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC\napproximate estimated alectinib free concentrations in the plasma.\nIn vitro studies suggest that alectinib is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but M4\nis a substrate of P-gp. Alectinib and M4 are not substrates of breast cancer resistance\nprotein (BCRP), organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, or OATP1B3.\nElimination\nThe apparent clearance (CL/F) is 81.9 L/hour for alectinib and 217 L/hour for M4. The\ngeometric mean elimination half-life is 33 hours for alectinib and 31 hours for M4 in\nmax,ss\n0-12h,ss\n0-inf\npatients with ALK-positive NSCLC.\nMetabolism\nAlectinib is metabolized by CYP3A4 to its major active metabolite M4. The geometric\nmean metabolite/parent exposure ratio at steady-state is 0.40. M4 is subsequently\nmetabolized by CYP3A4. Alectinib and M4 were the main circulating moieties in plasma,\nconstituting 76% of the total radioactivity.\nExcretion\nNinety-eight percent of the radioactivity was excreted in feces following oral\nadministration of a single radiolabeled dose of alectinib under fed conditions. Eighty-four\npercent of the dose was excreted in the feces as unchanged alectinib, and 6% of the\ndose was excreted as M4. Excretion of radioactivity in urine was less than 0.5% of\nadministered radiolabeled dose of alectinib.\nSpecific Populations\nAge (21 to 83 years), body weight (38 to 128 kg), mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin\n\u2264 ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin 1 to \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN and AST any value), mild to\nmoderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 89 mL/min), race (White, Asian,\nand Other), and sex had no clinically meaningful effect on the systemic exposure of\nalectinib and M4. The pharmacokinetics of alectinib have not been studied in patients\nwith severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), or end-stage renal\ndisease.\nHepatic Impairment: Following administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg ALECENSA,\nthe geometric mean ratio [90% confidence interval] for the combined AUC\n of alectinib\nand M4 in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) was 1.36 [0.947,\n1.96] and in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) was 1.76 [0.984,\n3.15] as compared to that in subjects with normal hepatic function. The combined C\nof alectinib and M4 was comparable among the three groups. No dose adjustment is\nrecommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. The\nrecommended dose of ALECENSA in patients with severe hepatic impairment is 450 mg\norally twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations\n(8.7)].\nDrug Interactions\nEffect of Other Drugs on Alectinib\nNo clinically meaningful effect on the combined exposure of alectinib plus M4 was\nobserved in clinical studies following co-administration of ALECENSA with a strong\nCYP3A inhibitor (posaconazole), a strong CYP3A inducer (rifampin), or an acid-reducing\nagent (esomeprazole).\nEffect of Alectinib on Other Drugs\nNo clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A substrate)\nor repaglinide (sensitive CYP2C8 substrate) is expected following co-administration with\nALECENSA.\nIn vitro studies suggest that alectinib and M4 do not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19 or\n2D6.\nIn vitro studies suggest that alectinib and M4 inhibit P-gp and BCRP. Alectinib did not\ninf\nmax\ninhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2 transport activity in vitro.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies with alectinib have not been conducted.\nAlectinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay, but\nwas positive with an increased number of micronuclei in a rat bone marrow\nmicronucleus test. The mechanism of micronucleus induction was abnormal\nchromosome segregation (aneugenicity) and not a clastogenic effect on chromosomes.\nNo studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of alectinib on fertility.\nNo adverse effects on male and female reproductive organs were observed in general\ntoxicology studies conducted in rats and monkeys.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 Adjuvant Treatment of Resected ALK-Positive NSCLC\nThe efficacy of ALECENSA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with ALK-positive\nNSCLC following complete tumor resection was evaluated in a global, randomized open-\nlabel clinical trial (ALINA: NCT03456076). Eligible patients were required to have\nresectable ALK-positive NSCLC, Stage IB (tumors \u2265 4 cm) \u2013 IIIA per the Union for\nInternational Cancer Control/American Joint Committee on Cancer (UICC/AJCC) Staging\nSystem, 7\n Edition. ALK rearrangements were identified by a locally performed FDA-\napproved ALK test or by a centrally performed VENTANA ALK (D5F3) CDx assay.\nRandomization was stratified by race (Asian vs. other races) and stage of disease (IB vs.\nII vs. IIIA). Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive ALECENSA 600 mg orally twice\ndaily or platinum-based chemotherapy following tumor resection. Treatment with\nALECENSA continued for a total of 2 years, or until disease recurrence or unacceptable\ntoxicity. Platinum-based chemotherapy was administered intravenously for 4 cycles, with\neach cycle lasting 21 days, according to one of the following regimens:\nCisplatin 75 mg/m  on Day 1 plus vinorelbine 25 mg/m  on Days 1 and 8\nCisplatin 75 mg/m  on Day 1 plus gemcitabine 1250 mg/m  on Days 1 and 8\nCisplatin 75 mg/m  on Day 1 plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m  on Day 1\nIn the event of intolerance to a cisplatin-based regimen, carboplatin was administered\ninstead of cisplatin in the above combinations at a dose of AUC 5 mg/mL/min or 6\nmg/mL/min.\nThe major efficacy outcome measures were disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with\nstage II-IIIA NSCLC and DFS in patients with stage IB-IIIA NSCLC (intent-to-treat [ITT]\npopulation) as assessed by investigator. DFS was defined as the time from date of\nrandomization to the date of occurrence of any of the following: first documented\nrecurrence of disease, new primary NSCLC, or death due to any cause, whichever\noccurred first. An additional efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS) in the\nITT population.\nA total of 257 patients were randomized to ALECENSA (N=130) or to chemotherapy\nth\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(N=127). The median age was 56 years (range: 26 to 87), 24% were \u2265 65 years old;\n52% were female; 56% were Asian, 42% were White, 0.4% were Black or African\nAmerican, 2.3% were race unknown; 0.4% were Hispanic or Latino; 60% were never\nsmokers; 53% had an ECOG PS of 0; 10% of patients had Stage IB, 35% had Stage II\nand 55% had Stage IIIA disease.\nALINA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in DFS for patients treated\nwith ALECENSA compared to patients treated with chemotherapy. OS data were not\nmature at the time of DFS analysis with 2.3% of deaths reported in the ITT population.\nThe efficacy results from ALINA are summarized in Table 10 and Figure 1.\nTable 10: Investigator-Assessed DFS Results in ALINA\nEfficacy\nParameter\nStage II-IIIA Population\nITT Population\nALECENSA\nN=116\nChemotherapy\nN=115\nALECENSA\nN=130\nChemotherapy\nN=127\nDFS = Disease-Free Survival; ITT = Intent-to-Treat; CI = Confidence\nInterval; NR = Not Reached; NE = Not Estimable.\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\nDFS events\n(%)\n14 (12)\n45 (39)\n15 (12)\n50 (39)\n  Disease\nrecurrence\n(%)\n14 (12)\n44 (38)\n15 (12)\n49 (38)\n  Death\n0\n1 (0.9)\n0\n1 (0.8)\nMedian DFS,\nmonths\n(95% CI)\nNR\n(NE, NE)\n44.4\n(27.8, NE)\nNR\n(NE, NE)\n41.3\n(28.5, NE)\nHazard Ratio\n(95% CI)\n0.24 (0.13, 0.45)\n0.24 (0.13, 0.43)\np-value\n<0.0001\n<0.0001\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier Curves of Investigator-Assessed DFS (ITT Population)\nin ALINA\nKaplan-Meier method.\nStratified Cox model, stratified by race (Asian vs. other races) in Stage II-IIIA\nand stratified by race (Asian vs. other races) and tumor stage (Stage IB vs. II\nvs. IIIA) in ITT.\nStratified log-rank test stratified by race (Asian vs. other races) in Stage II-IIIA\nand stratified by race (Asian vs. other races) and tumor stage (Stage IB vs. II\nvs. IIIA) in ITT.\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\nIn an exploratory analysis of site(s) of relapse, the proportion of patients with brain\ninvolvement at the time of disease recurrence was 4 patients (3.1%) in the ALECENSA\narm and 14 patients (11%) in the chemotherapy arm.\n14.2 Treatment of Metastatic ALK-Positive NSCLC\nPreviously Untreated Metastatic ALK-Positive NSCLC\nThe efficacy of ALECENSA for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who\nhad not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease was established in an\nopen-label, randomized, active-controlled, multicenter study (ALEX: NCT02075840).\nPatients were required to have an ECOG performance status of 0-2 and ALK-positive\nNSCLC as identified by the VENTANA ALK (D5F3) CDx assay. Neurologically stable\npatients with treated or untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases, including\nleptomeningeal metastases, were eligible; patients with neurologic signs and symptoms\ndue to CNS metastases were required to have completed whole brain radiation or\ngamma knife irradiation at least 14 days prior to enrollment and be clinically stable.\nPatients with a baseline QTc > 470 ms were ineligible.\nPatients were randomized 1:1 to receive ALECENSA 600 mg orally twice daily or\ncrizotinib 250 mg orally twice daily. Randomization was stratified by ECOG performance\nstatus (0/1 vs. 2), race (Asian vs. other races), and the presence or absence of CNS\nmetastases at baseline. Treatment on both arms was continued until disease\nprogression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was\nprogression-free survival (PFS) as determined by investigator assessment according to\nRECIST v1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS as determined by\nindependent review committee (IRC), time to CNS progression by IRC based on RECIST\nv1.1, objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR), and OS. Additional\nexploratory outcome measures were CNS objective response rate (CNS-ORR) and CNS\nduration of response (CNS-DOR) by IRC in patients with CNS metastases at baseline.\nA total of 303 patients were randomized to ALECENSA (n=152) or crizotinib (n=151).\nThe demographic characteristics of the study population were 56% female, median age\n56 years (range: 18 to 91 years), 50% White, 46% Asian, 1% Black, and 3% other races.\nThe majority of patients had adenocarcinoma (92%) and never smoked (63%). CNS\nmetastases were present in 40% (n=122) of patients: of these, 43 patients had\nmeasurable CNS lesions as determined by an IRC. The ALEX study demonstrated a\nsignificant improvement in PFS. The time to cause-specific CNS progression as assessed\nby IRC was also significantly improved; there was a lower incidence of progression in the\nCNS as the first site of disease progression, alone or with concurrent systemic\nprogression, in the ALECENSA arm (12%) as compared to the crizotinib arm (45%).\nEfficacy results from ALEX are summarized in Table 11 and Figure 2.\nTable 11: Efficacy Results in ALEX per IRC Assessment\nALECENSA\nN=152\nCrizotinib\nN=151\nCNS: central nervous system, ORR: overall response rate, IRC:\nindependent review committee, CI: confidence interval, NE: not\nestimable.\n*\n\u2020\nProgression-Free Survival\n  Number of events (%)\n63 (41%)\n92 (61%)\n    Progressive disease (%)\n51 (34%)\n82 (54%)\n    Death (%)\n12 (8%)\n10 (7%)\n  Median in months (95% CI)\n25.7 (19.9, NE) 10.4 (7.7, 14.6)\n  Hazard ratio (95% CI) \n0.53 (0.38, 0.73)\n  P-value \n< 0.0001\nOverall Response Rate\n  Overall response rate, % (95%\nCI) \n79% (72, 85)\n72% (64, 79)\n  P-value \n0.1652\n  Complete response, %\n13%\n6%\n  Partial response, %\n66%\n66%\nDuration of Response\n  Number of responders\nn=120\nn=109\n  Response duration \u22656 months\n82%\n57%\n  Response duration \u226512\nmonths\n64%\n36%\n  Response duration \u226518\nmonths\n37%\n14%\nFigure 2: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Progression-Free Survival (IRC) in ALEX\nStratified by race (Asian vs. other races) and CNS metastases at baseline\n(yes vs. no) for Cox model, log-rank test and Cochran Mantel-Haenszel\ntest, respectively\nClopper and Pearson exact binomial 95% confidence interval.\n*\n*\n\u2020\n*\nResults for PFS as determined by investigator assessment (HR=0.48 [95% CI: 0.35-\n0.66], stratified log-rank p<0.0001) were similar to that observed by IRC.

Patients with\nlocally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC, who have progressed on crizotinib,\nClopper and Pearson exact binomial 95% confidence interval\n*\nwith documented ALK-positive NSCLC based on an FDA-approved test, and ECOG PS of\n0-2 were enrolled in both studies. Eligibility criteria permitted enrollment of patients with\nprior chemotherapy and prior CNS radiotherapy provided that CNS metastases were\nstable for at least two weeks. All patients received ALECENSA 600 mg orally twice daily.\nThe major efficacy outcome measure in both studies was objective response rate (ORR)\naccording to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) as evaluated\nper Independent Review Committee (IRC). Additional outcome measures as evaluated by\nthe IRC included duration of response (DOR), CNS ORR, and CNS DOR.\nNP28761 was conducted in North America and enrolled 87 patients. Baseline\ndemographic and disease characteristics in NP28761 were median age 54 years old\n(range 29 to 79, 18% 65 and over), 84% White and 8% Asian, 55% female, 35% ECOG\nPS 0 and 55% ECOG PS 1, 100% never or former smokers, 99% Stage IV, 94%\nadenocarcinoma, and 74% prior chemotherapy. The most common sites of extra-\nthoracic metastasis included 60% CNS (of whom 65% had received CNS radiation), 43%\nlymph nodes, 36% bone, and 34% liver.\nNP28673 was conducted internationally and enrolled 138 patients. Baseline demographic\nand disease characteristics in NP28673 were median age 52 years old (range 22 to 79,\n10% 65 and over), 67% White and 26% Asian, 56% female, 32% ECOG PS 0 and 59%\nECOG PS 1, 98% never or former smokers, 99% Stage IV, 96% adenocarcinoma, and\n80% prior chemotherapy. The most common sites of extra-thoracic metastasis included\n61% CNS (of whom 73% had received CNS radiation), 51% bone, 38% lymph nodes, and\n30% liver.\nEfficacy results from NP28761 and NP28673 in all treated patients are summarized in\nTable 13. The median duration of follow-up on Study NP28761 was 4.8 months for both\nIRC and Investigator assessments and on Study NP28673, 10.9 months for IRC\nassessment and 7.0 months for Investigator assessment.

Liver problems are common with ALECENSA\nand can be severe. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests at least every 2\nweeks for the first 3 months, and then 1 time each month and as needed during\ntreatment with ALECENSA to check your liver function. Tell your healthcare\nprovider right away if you get any of the following signs and symptoms:\nfeeling tired\nfeeling less hungry than usual\nyellowing of your skin or the whites of\nyour eyes\ndark urine\nitchy skin\nnausea or vomiting\npain on the right side of your stomach\narea\nbleeding or bruising more easily than\nnormal\nLung problems. ALECENSA may cause severe or life-threatening swelling\n(inflammation) of the lungs during treatment. Symptoms may be similar to those\nsymptoms from lung cancer. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any\nnew or worsening symptoms, including trouble breathing, shortness of breath,\ncough, or fever.\nKidney problems. ALECENSA may cause severe kidney problems that can lead to\ndeath. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have a change in the amount or\ncolor of your urine, or if you get new or worsening swelling in your legs or feet.\nSlow heartbeat (bradycardia). ALECENSA may cause very slow heartbeats that\ncan be severe. Your healthcare provider will check your heart rate and blood\npressure during treatment with ALECENSA. Tell your healthcare provider right away if\nyou feel dizzy, lightheaded, or if you faint during treatment with ALECENSA. Tell your\nhealthcare provider if you take any heart or blood pressure medicines.\nSevere muscle pain, tenderness, and weakness (myalgia). Muscle problems\nare common with ALECENSA and can be severe. Your healthcare provider will do\nblood tests at least every 2 weeks for the first month and as needed during\ntreatment with ALECENSA. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get new or\nworsening signs and symptoms of muscle problems, including unexplained muscle\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\npain or muscle pain that does not go away, tenderness, or weakness.\nBreakdown of healthy red blood cells earlier than normal (hemolytic\nanemia). Hemolytic anemia can happen in some people who take ALECENSA. If this\nhappens, you may not have enough healthy red blood cells. Your healthcare provider\nmay temporarily stop ALECENSA and do blood tests, if needed, to check for this\nproblem. If you develop hemolytic anemia, your healthcare provider may either\nrestart you on ALECENSA at a lower dose when the hemolytic anemia goes away, or\nmay stop your treatment with ALECENSA. Tell your healthcare provider right away if\nyou experience yellow skin (jaundice), weakness or dizziness, or shortness of breath.\nSee \"What are the possible side effects of ALECENSA?\" for more information\nabout side effects.\nWhat is ALECENSA? \nALECENSA is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with non-small cell lung cancer\n(NSCLC) that is caused by an abnormal anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene:\nto help prevent your lung cancer from coming back after your tumor has been\nremoved by surgery (adjuvant), or\nas treatment when your lung cancer has spread to other parts of your body\n(metastatic).\nYour healthcare provider will perform a test to make sure that ALECENSA is right for\nyou.\nIt is not known if ALECENSA is safe and effective in children.\nBefore you take ALECENSA, tell your healthcare provider about all of your\nmedical conditions, including if you:\nhave liver problems\nhave lung or breathing problems\nhave a slow heartbeat\nare pregnant or plan to become pregnant. ALECENSA can harm your unborn baby.\nFemales who are able to become pregnant:\nYour healthcare provider will do a test to see if you are pregnant before starting\ntreatment with ALECENSA.\nYou should use effective birth control (contraception) during treatment with\nALECENSA and for 5 weeks after the last dose of ALECENSA.\nTell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant during treatment\nwith ALECENSA or think you may be pregnant.\nMales who have female partners that are able to become pregnant should use\neffective birth control (contraception) during treatment with ALECENSA and for 3\nmonths after the last dose of ALECENSA.\nare breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if ALECENSA passes into\nyour breast milk. Do not breastfeed during treatment with ALECENSA and for 1 week\nafter the last dose of ALECENSA. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way\nto feed your baby during this time.\nTell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including\nprescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or herbal supplements.\nHow should I take ALECENSA?\nTake ALECENSA exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to take it. Do not\nchange your dose or stop taking ALECENSA unless your healthcare provider tells you\nto.\nYour healthcare provider may change your dose, temporarily stop, or permanently\nstop treatment with ALECENSA if you have side effects.\nTake ALECENSA 2 times a day.\nTake ALECENSA with food.\nSwallow ALECENSA capsules whole. Do not open or dissolve the capsule contents.\nIf you miss a dose of ALECENSA, do not take the missed dose.

Important\nimmune-mediated adverse reactions listed under Warnings and Precautions may not\ninclude all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions.\nThe incidence and severity of immune-mediated adverse reactions were similar when\nLIBTAYO was administered as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy.\nImmune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any\norgan system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time\nafter starting PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. While immune-mediated adverse reactions\nusually manifest during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, immune-\nmediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1\nblocking antibodies. Immune-mediated adverse reactions affecting more than one body\nsystem can occur simultaneously.\nEarly identification and management of immune\u2010mediated adverse reactions are\nessential to ensure safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor closely for\nsymptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated\nadverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline\nand periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse\nreactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including\ninfection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as\nappropriate.\nWithhold or permanently discontinue LIBTAYO depending on severity [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3)]. In general, if LIBTAYO requires interruption or discontinuation,\nadminister systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent)\nuntil improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate\ncorticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider\nadministration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-\nmediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroids.\nToxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require\nsystemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed\nbelow.\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis\nLIBTAYO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The definition of immune-mediated\npneumonitis included the required use of systemic corticosteroids or other\nimmunosuppressants and the absence of a clear alternate etiology. In patients treated\nwith other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies the incidence of pneumonitis is higher in\npatients who have received prior thoracic radiation.\nImmune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% (33/1281) of patients receiving\nLIBTAYO, including Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.6%), and Grade 2 (1.6%) adverse\nreactions. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of LIBTAYO in 1.3% of patients\nand withholding of LIBTAYO in 1.4% of the patients.\nSystemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis\nresolved in 61% of the 33 patients. Of the 18 patients in whom LIBTAYO was withheld\nfor pneumonitis, 10 reinitiated LIBTAYO after symptom improvement; of these, 4/10\n(40%) had recurrence of pneumonitis.\nImmune-Mediated Colitis\nLIBTAYO can cause immune-mediated colitis. The definition of immune-mediated colitis\nincluded the required use of systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants\nand the absence of a clear alternate etiology. The primary component of the immune-\nmediated colitis was diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been\nreported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis treated with\nPD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider\nrepeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies.\nImmune-mediated colitis occurred in 2% (25/1281) of patients receiving LIBTAYO,\nincluding Grade 3 (0.8%) and Grade 2 (0.9%) adverse reactions. Colitis led to permanent\ndiscontinuation of LIBTAYO in 0.4% of patients and withholding of LIBTAYO in 1.2% of\npatients.\nSystemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with colitis. Colitis resolved in 56%\nof the 25 patients. Of the 16 patients in whom LIBTAYO was withheld for colitis, 6\nreinitiated LIBTAYO after symptom improvement; of these, 4/6 (67%) had recurrence of\ncolitis.\nImmune-Mediated Hepatitis\nLIBTAYO can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. The definition of immune-mediated\nhepatitis included the required use of systemic corticosteroids or other\nimmunosuppressants and the absence of a clear alternate etiology.\nImmune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 2.4% (31/1281) of patients receiving LIBTAYO,\nincluding fatal (< 0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (1.6%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) adverse\nreactions. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of LIBTAYO in 1.4% of patients and\nwithholding of LIBTAYO in 0.7% of patients.\nSystemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with hepatitis. Thirteen percent\n(13%) of these patients (4/31) required additional immunosuppression with\nmycophenolate. Hepatitis resolved in 39% of the 31 patients. Of the 9 patients in whom\nLIBTAYO was withheld for hepatitis, 5 patients reinitiated LIBTAYO after symptom\nimprovement; of these, 1/5 (20%) had recurrence of hepatitis.\nImmune-Mediated Endocrinopathies\nAdrenal Insufficiency\nLIBTAYO can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher\nadrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as\nclinically indicated. Withhold LIBTAYO depending on severity [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3)].\nAdrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.5% (6/1281) of patients receiving LIBTAYO, including\nGrade 3 (0.5%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent\ndiscontinuation of LIBTAYO in 1 (< 0.1%) patient. LIBTAYO was withheld in 1 (< 0.1%)\npatient due to adrenal insufficiency and not reinitiated. Systemic corticosteroids were\nrequired in 83% (5/6) patients with adrenal insufficiency; of these, the majority remained\non systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency resolved in 17% of the 6 patients.\nHypophysitis\nLIBTAYO can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute\nsymptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field\ndefects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as\nclinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue LIBTAYO depending on severity\n[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\nHypophysitis occurred in 0.5% (7/1281) of patients receiving LIBTAYO, including Grade 3\n(0.2%) and Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions. Hypophysitis led to permanent\ndiscontinuation of LIBTAYO in 1 (< 0.1%) patient and withholding of LIBTAYO in 2 (0.2%)\npatients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 86% (6/7) patients with hypophysitis.\nHypophysitis resolved in 14% of the 7 patients. Of the 2 patients in whom LIBTAYO was\nwithheld for hypophysitis, none of the patients reinitiated.\nThyroid Disorders\nLIBTAYO can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or\nwithout endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone\nreplacement or medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold\nor permanently discontinue LIBTAYO depending on severity [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3)].\nThyroiditis: Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (8/1281) of patients receiving LIBTAYO, including\nGrade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions. No patient discontinued LIBTAYO due to thyroiditis.\nThyroiditis led to withholding of LIBTAYO in 1 (< 0.1%) patient. Systemic corticosteroids\nwere not required in any patient with thyroiditis. Thyroiditis resolved in 13% of the 8\npatients.\nBlood thyroid stimulating hormone increased and blood thyroid stimulating hormone\ndecreased have also been reported.\nHyperthyroidism: Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3% (39/1281) of patients receiving\nLIBTAYO, including Grade 3 (< 0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.9%) adverse reactions. No patient\ndiscontinued treatment due to hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism led to withholding of\nLIBTAYO in 7 (0.5%) patients.\nSystemic corticosteroids were required in 8% (3/39) of patients with hyperthyroidism.\nHyperthyroidism resolved in 56% of the 39 patients. Of the 7 patients in whom LIBTAYO\nwas withheld for hyperthyroidism, 2 patients reinitiated LIBTAYO after symptom\nimprovement; of these, none had recurrence of hyperthyroidism.\nHypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism occurred in 7% (87/1281) of patients receiving\nLIBTAYO, including Grade 3 (< 0.1%) and Grade 2 (6%) adverse reactions.\nHypothyroidism led to permanent discontinuation of LIBTAYO in 3 (0.2%) patients.\nHypothyroidism led to withholding of LIBTAYO in 9 (0.7%) patients.\nSystemic corticosteroids were required in 1.1% (1/87) of patients. Hypothyroidism\nresolved in 6% of the 87 patients. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required\nlong-term thyroid hormone replacement.\nOf the 9 patients in whom LIBTAYO was withheld for hypothyroidism, 1 reinitiated\nLIBTAYO after symptom improvement and did not have recurrence of hypothyroidism.\nType 1 Diabetes Mellitus, which can present with diabetic ketoacidosis\nMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate\ntreatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold LIBTAYO depending on severity\n[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\nType 1 diabetes mellitus occurred in < 0.1% (1/1281) of patients (Grade 4). No patient\ndiscontinued treatment due to type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes mellitus led to\nwithholding of LIBTAYO in 0.1% of patients, treatment was reinitiated after symptom\nimprovement. Patient received long-term insulin therapy.\nImmune-Mediated Nephritis with Renal Dysfunction\nLIBTAYO can cause immune-mediated nephritis. The definition of immune-mediated\nnephritis included the required use of systemic corticosteroids or other\nimmunosuppressants and the absence of a clear alternate etiology.\nImmune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.7% (9/1281) patients receiving LIBTAYO,\nincluding fatal (< 0.1%), Grade 3 (< 0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.5%) adverse reactions.\nNephritis led to permanent discontinuation of LIBTAYO in 0.2% of patients and\nwithholding of LIBTAYO in 0.4% of patients.\nSystemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with nephritis. Nephritis resolved in\n78% of the 9 patients. Of the 5 patients in whom LIBTAYO was withheld for nephritis, 4\nreinitiated LIBTAYO after symptom improvement; of these, 1/4 (25%) had recurrence of\nnephritis.\nImmune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions\nLIBTAYO can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. The definition of immune-\nmediated dermatologic adverse reaction included the required use of systemic\ncorticosteroids or other immunosuppressants and the absence of a clear alternate\netiology. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic\nepidermal necrolysis (TEN), and DRESS (Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic\nSymptoms), has occurred with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Topical emollients and/or\ntopical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate non-exfoliative\nrashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue LIBTAYO depending on severity [see\nDosage and Administration (2.3)].\nImmune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.9% (24/1281) of\npatients receiving LIBTAYO, including Grade 3 (0.9%) and Grade 2 (0.8%) adverse\nreactions. Dermatologic adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of LIBTAYO\nin 0.2% of patients and withholding of LIBTAYO in 1.3% of patients.\nSystemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with immune-mediated\ndermatologic adverse reactions. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions\nresolved in 71% of the 24 patients. Of the 17 patients in whom LIBTAYO was withheld\nfor dermatologic adverse reaction, 13 reinitiated LIBTAYO after symptom improvement;\nof these 5/13 (38%) had recurrence of the dermatologic adverse reaction.\nOther Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions\nThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an\nincidence of < 1% in 1281 patients who received LIBTAYO or were reported with the use\nof other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for\nsome of these adverse reactions.\nCardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis\nNervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic\nsyndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barre syndrome, nerve\nparesis, autoimmune neuropathy\nOcular: Uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities. Some cases can be\nassociated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment to include\nblindness can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated\nadverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada like syndrome, as this may require\ntreatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss\nGastrointestinal: Pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels,\ngastritis, duodenitis, stomatitis\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis/dermatomyositis,\nrhabdomyolysis and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia\nrheumatica\nEndocrine: Hypoparathyroidism\nOther (Hematologic/Immune): Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic\nlymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing\nlymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenia, solid\norgan transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection\n5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions\nSevere or life-threatening infusion-related reactions occurred in 0.2% of patients\nreceiving LIBTAYO as a single agent. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of\ninfusion-related reactions. Common symptoms of infusion-related reaction include\nnausea, pyrexia, and vomiting.\nInterrupt or slow the rate of infusion or permanently discontinue LIBTAYO based on\nseverity of reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.3 Complications of Allogeneic HSCT\nFatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic\nhematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-\n1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-\nversus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive\ndisease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile\nsyndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur\ndespite intervening therapy between PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT.\nFollow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene\npromptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking\nantibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.\n5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on its mechanism of action, LIBTAYO can cause fetal harm when administered to\na pregnant woman. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1\npathway can lead to increased risk of immune-mediated rejection of the developing fetus\nresulting in fetal death. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of\nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LIBTAYO and\nfor at least 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling.\nSevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions\n(5.1)]\nInfusion-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nComplications of Allogeneic HSCT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe data described in Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to LIBTAYO as a single\nagent in 1281 patients in three open-label, single-arm, multicohort studies, and two\nopen-label randomized multi-center studies. These studies included 384 patients with\nadvanced CSCC (Studies 1540 and 1423), 138 patients with advanced BCC (Study\n1620), 355 patients with NSCLC (Study 1624), and 404 patients with other advanced\nsolid tumors. LIBTAYO was administered intravenously at doses of 3 mg/kg every 2\nweeks (n=235), 350 mg every 3 weeks (n=1014), or other doses (n=32). Among the\n1281 patients, 53% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 26% were exposed for\none year or longer. In this pooled safety population, the most common adverse\nreactions (\u226515%) were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, rash, diarrhea, and anemia. The\nmost common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (\u22652%) were lymphopenia, anemia,\nhyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, hypokalemia,\nhyperkalemia, and increased alanine aminotransferase.\nIn addition, the data below reflect exposure to LIBTAYO in combination with platinum-\nbased chemotherapy in 312 patients with NSCLC enrolled in a randomized, active\ncontrolled trial (Study 16113).\nCutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC)\nStudy 1540\nThe safety of LIBTAYO was evaluated in 358 patients with advanced CSCC (metastatic or\nlocally advanced disease) in Study 1540 [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Of these 358\npatients, 213 had mCSCC (nodal or distant) and 145 had laCSCC. Patients received\nLIBTAYO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=137) or 350 mg every 3 weeks (n=221) as an\nintravenous infusion until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of\nplanned treatment. The median duration of exposure was 40 weeks (1 week to 109\nweeks).\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients. Serious adverse reactions that\noccurred in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia (3.6%), skin infection (3.6%), and\npneumonitis (2.8%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 5% of patients who received\nLIBTAYO, including deaths due to infections (2.2%).\nPermanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 12% of patients.\nAdverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation in at least 2 patients were\npneumonitis, rash, confusional state, general physical health deterioration, hemorrhage,\nliver function test abnormalities, and musculoskeletal pain.\nDosage interruptions of LIBTAYO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 36% of\npatients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in \u2265 2% of patients\nincluded diarrhea, infusion-related reaction, upper respiratory tract infection, liver\nfunction test abnormalities, musculoskeletal pain, pneumonitis, and rash.\nThe most common (\u2265 20%) adverse reactions were fatigue, rash, musculoskeletal pain,\ndiarrhea, pruritus, and nausea. The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (\u2265\n2%) were hypertension, skin infection, pneumonia, anemia, fatigue, musculoskeletal\npain, and pneumonitis. The most common (\u2265 4%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities\nworsening from baseline were lymphopenia, hyponatremia, anemia, and\nhypophosphatemia.\nTable 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 10% of patients and Table\n3 summarizes Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities worsening from baseline in \u2265 1% of\npatients receiving LIBTAYO.\nTable 2: Adverse Reactions in \u2265 10% of Patients with\nAdvanced CSCC Receiving LIBTAYO in Study 1540\nAdverse Reactions\nLIBTAYO\nN = 358\nAll Grades\n%\nGrades 3-4\n%\nGeneral and Administration Site\nFatigue\n38\n2.2\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue\nRash\n34\n1.7\nPruritus\n22\n0.3\nActinic keratosis\n10\n0\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue\nMusculoskeletal pain\n33\n2.5\nGastrointestinal\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\nToxicity was graded per National Cancer Institute Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v.4.03\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\n#\n\u00de\n\u00df\n\u00e0\n\u00e8\n\u00f0\nDiarrhea\n26\n1.1\nNausea\n21\n0\nConstipation\n13\n0.3\nVomiting\n11\n0.6\nInfections and infestations\nUpper respiratory tract infection\n14\n1.1\nSkin infection\n11\n4.5\nRespiratory\nCough\n12\n0\nMetabolism and Nutrition\nDecreased appetite\n11\n0.6\nNervous system disorders\nHeadache\n10\n0\nDizziness\n10\n0.3\nTable 3: Grade 3 or 4 Laboratory Abnormalities Worsening\nfrom Baseline in \u2265 1% of Patients with Advanced CSCC\nReceiving LIBTAYO in Study 1540\nLaboratory Abnormality\nGrade 3-4 (%)\nHematology\n  Lymphopenia\n7.0\n  Anemia\n4.1\nFatigue is a composite term that includes fatigue and asthenia\nRash is a composite term that includes rash, rash maculo-papular, dermatitis,\nerythema, eczema, dermatitis bullous, rash erythematous, dermatitis\nacneiform, psoriasis, dermatitis contact, blister, pemphigoid, rash papular,\nhand dermatitis, skin exfoliation, autoimmune dermatitis, rash pruritic, rash\nmacular, rash pustular, urticaria, dermatitis atopic, drug eruption, eczema\nasteatotic, skin reaction, dermatitis psoriasiform, eczema nummular,\nexfoliative rash, and immune-mediated dermatitis\nPruritus is a composite term that includes pruritus and pruritus allergic\nMusculoskeletal pain is a composite term that includes arthralgia, back pain,\nmyalgia, polyarthritis, pain in extremity, neck pain, non-cardiac chest pain,\narthritis, musculoskeletal chest pain, musculoskeletal pain, musculoskeletal\nstiffness, bone pain, immune-mediated arthritis, and spinal pain\nDiarrhea is a composite term that includes diarrhea, colitis, and autoimmune\ncolitis\nVomiting is a composite term that includes hematemesis and vomiting\nUpper respiratory tract infection is a composite term that includes upper\nrespiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, influenza-like illness,\nrhinitis, influenza, viral upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory tract\ninfection, influenza A virus test positive, and pharyngitis\nSkin infection is a composite term that includes skin infection, cellulitis, fungal\nskin infection, and staphylococcal skin infection\nCough is a composite term that includes cough, productive cough, and upper\nairway cough syndrome\nHeadache is a composite term that includes headache, sinus headache, and\nmigraine\nDizziness is a composite term that includes dizziness, vertigo, vertigo\npositional, and dizziness postural\n\u00b6\n#\n\u00de\n\u00df\n\u00e0\n\u00e8\n\u00f0\n*\nToxicity graded per NCI CTCAE v. 4.03\n*\nElectrolytes\n  Hyponatremia\n4.9\n  Hypophosphatemia\n4.1\n  Hypercalcemia\n2.0\n  Hypokalemia\n1.5\nCoagulation\n  Increased INR\n2.9\nChemistry\n  Increased aspartate\naminotransferase\n1.5\n  Hypoalbuminemia\n1.2\nStudy 1423\nIn 26 patients with advanced CSCC treated with LIBTAYO in Study 1423 [see Clinical\nStudies (14.1)], safety data were consistent with those described above from Study\n1540.\nBasal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)\nThe safety of LIBTAYO was evaluated in 138 patients with advanced BCC (mBCC N=54,\nlaBCC N=84) in an open-label, single-arm trial (Study 1620) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].\nPatients received LIBTAYO 350 mg every 3 weeks as an intravenous infusion for up to\n93 weeks or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

There are no available data on the\nuse of LIBTAYO in pregnant women. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of\nthe PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-mediated rejection of the\ndeveloping fetus resulting in fetal death (see Data). Human IgG4 immunoglobulins (IgG4)\nare known to cross the placenta; therefore, LIBTAYO has the potential to be transmitted\nfrom the mother to the developing fetus. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\n*\nPercentages are based on the number of patients with at least 1 post-\nbaseline value available for that parameter\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with LIBTAYO to evaluate its\neffect on reproduction and fetal development. A central function of the PD-1/PD-L1\npathway is to preserve pregnancy by maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the\nfetus. In murine models of pregnancy, blockade of PD-L1 signaling has been shown to\ndisrupt tolerance to the fetus and to result in an increase in fetal loss; therefore,\npotential risks of administering LIBTAYO during pregnancy include increased rates of\nabortion or stillbirth. As reported in the literature, there were no malformations related\nto the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling in the offspring of these animals; however,\nimmune-mediated disorders occurred in PD-1 and PD-L1 knockout mice. Based on its\nmechanism of action, fetal exposure to cemiplimab-rwlc may increase the risk of\ndeveloping immune-mediated disorders or altering the normal immune response.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere is no information regarding the presence of cemiplimab-rwlc in human milk, or its\neffects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious\nadverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during\ntreatment and for at least 4 months after the last dose of LIBTAYO.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating LIBTAYO\n[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nContraception\nLIBTAYO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.1)].\nFemales\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment\nwith LIBTAYO and for at least 4 months after the last dose.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of LIBTAYO have not been established in pediatric patients.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nLIBTAYO as a Single Agent\nOf the 1281 patients who received LIBTAYO as a single agent in clinical studies, 26%\nwere 65 years up to 75 years and 22% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in\nsafety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients.\nOf the 358 patients with mCSCC or laCSCC who received LIBTAYO as a single agent in\nStudy 1540, 30% were 65 years up to 75 years and 48% were 75 years or older. No\noverall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and\nyounger patients.\nOf the 138 patients with BCC who received LIBTAYO as a single agent in Study 1620,\n27% were 65 years up to 75 years, and 31% were 75 years or older. No overall\ndifferences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and\nyounger patients.\nLIBTAYO in Combination with Platinum-based Chemotherapy\nOf the 312 patients with NSCLC who received LIBTAYO in combination with platinum-\nbased chemotherapy in Study 16113, 35% were 65 years up to 75 years and 6% were\n75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed\nbetween these patients and younger patients.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nCemiplimab-rwlc is a human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody.\nCemiplimab-rwlc is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1\nand blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2. Cemiplimab-rwlc is produced by\nrecombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell suspension culture.\nCemiplimab-rwlc has an approximate molecular weight of 146 kDa.\nLIBTAYO (cemiplimab-rwlc) injection for intravenous use is a sterile, preservative-free,\nclear to slightly opalescent, colorless to pale yellow solution with a pH of 6. The solution\nmay contain trace amounts of translucent to white particles.\nEach vial contains 350 mg of cemiplimab-rwlc. Each mL contains cemiplimab-rwlc 50 mg,\nL-histidine (0.74 mg), L-histidine monohydrochloride monohydrate (1.1 mg), sucrose (50\nmg), L-proline (15 mg), polysorbate 80 (2 mg), and Water for Injection, USP.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nBinding of the PD-1 ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells\ninhibits T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs\nin some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active\nT-cell immune surveillance of tumors.\nCemiplimab-rwlc is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal\nantibody that binds to PD-1 and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing\nPD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor\nimmune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in\ndecreased tumor growth.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nCemiplimab exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic\nresponse are not fully characterized.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nCemiplimab-rwlc pharmacokinetic data were collected in 1063 patients with various solid\ntumors. The pharmacokinetics of cemiplimab-rwlc were linear and dose proportional in\nthe dose range of 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg LIBTAYO administered intravenously every 2\nweeks.\nAt 350 mg every 3 weeks, the mean cemiplimab-rwlc concentrations (coefficient of\nvariation, CV%) at steady-state ranged between a minimum concentration of 59 mg/L\n(47%) and a maximum concentration of 171 mg/L (27%). Steady-state exposure is\nachieved after 4 months of treatment.\nIn patients with CSCC, cemiplimab-rwlc steady-state exposure at 350 mg every 3 weeks\nwas comparable to the exposure at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks.\nDistribution\nThe volume of distribution of cemiplimab-rwlc at steady state is 5.9 L (29%).\nElimination\nCemiplimab-rwlc clearance (CV%) after the first dose is 0.25 L/day (41%) and decreases\nover time by 11%, resulting in a steady-state clearance (CL\n) (CV%) of 0.22 L/day\n(44%). The elimination half-life (CV%) at steady state is 22 days (42%).\nSpecific Populations\nThe following factors have no clinically important effect on the exposure of cemiplimab-\nrwlc in 1063 patients: age (27 to 96 years), sex, body weight (31 to 172 kg), cancer\ntype, albumin level (20 to 93 g/L), renal function (creatinine clearance determined by\nCockcroft-Gault 21 mL/min or greater) and hepatic function (total bilirubin greater than\n1.0 times up to 3.0 times the ULN). Race [White (N=932), Asian (N=47), Black (N=21)]\nappears to have no clinically important effect on the exposure of cemiplimab-rwlc.\nLIBTAYO has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin\ngreater than 3.0 times the ULN).\n12.6 Immunogenicity\nThe observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and\nspecificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons\nof the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence\nof anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of cemiplimab-rwlc or of other\ncemiplimab products.\nDuring the treatment period ranging from 8 to 19 months in 5 clinical studies, the\nincidence of anti-cemiplimab-rwlc antibodies in LIBTAYO-treated patients was 2%\n(22/1029).\nThere was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-cemiplimab-rwlc antibodies on\nPK of LIBTAYO over the treatment duration ranging from 8 months to 19 months.\nBecause of the low occurrence of anti-drug antibodies, the effect of these antibodies on\nthe pharmacodynamics, safety, and/or effectiveness of LIBTAYO is unknown.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nss\nNo studies have been performed to assess the potential of cemiplimab-rwlc for\ncarcinogenicity or genotoxicity.\nIn a 3-month repeat-dose toxicology study in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys,\nthere were no cemiplimab-rwlc-related effects on fertility parameters (menstrual cycle,\nsemen analysis, or testicular measurements) or in male or female reproductive organs\nat doses up to the highest dose tested, 50 mg/kg/week (approximately 5.5 to 25.5 times\nthe human exposure based on AUC at the clinical dose of 350 mg once every 3 weeks).\n13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nIn animal models, inhibition of PD-L1/PD-1 signaling increased the severity of some\ninfections and enhanced inflammatory responses. M. tuberculosis\u2013infected PD-1\nknockout mice exhibit markedly decreased survival compared with wild-type controls,\nwhich correlated with increased bacterial proliferation and inflammatory responses in\nthese animals. PD-L1 and PD-1 knockout mice and mice receiving PD-L1 blocking\nantibody have also shown decreased survival following infection with lymphocytic\nchoriomeningitis virus.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC)\nThe efficacy of LIBTAYO in patients with metastatic (nodal or distant) cutaneous\nsquamous cell carcinoma (mCSCC) or locally advanced CSCC (laCSCC) who were not\ncandidates for curative surgery or curative radiation was evaluated in two open-label,\nmulti-center, non-randomized, multicohort studies: Study 1423 (NCT02383212) and\nStudy 1540 (NCT02760498). Both studies excluded patients with autoimmune disease\nthat required systemic therapy with immunosuppressant agents within 5 years; history\nof solid organ transplant; prior treatment with anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies or\nother immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy; infection with HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C;\nor ECOG PS \u2265 2.\nPatients received LIBTAYO 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks for up to 48 weeks in\nStudy 1423 or up to 96 weeks (Groups 1 and 2), or 350 mg every 3 weeks for up to 54\nweeks (Group 3) in Study 1540. Treatment continued until progression of disease,\nunacceptable toxicity, or completion of planned treatment. Tumor response\nassessments were performed every 8 or 9 weeks. The major efficacy outcome\nmeasures were confirmed objective response rate (ORR), defined as complete response\n(CR) plus partial response (PR) as assessed by independent central review (ICR), and\nICR-assessed duration of response (DOR). For patients with mCSCC without externally\nvisible target lesions, ORR was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid\nTumors (RECIST 1.1). For patients with externally visible target lesions (laCSCC and\nmCSCC), ORR was determined by a composite endpoint that integrated ICR\nassessments of radiologic data (RECIST 1.1) and digital medical photography (WHO\ncriteria).\nStudy 1540\nIn the efficacy analysis of 193 patients with advanced CSCC enrolled in Study 1540 who\nreceived LIBTAYO at either 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 350 mg every three weeks, 115\nhad mCSCC and 78 had laCSCC. The median age was 72 years (38 to 96 years); 83%\nwere male; 97% were White, 2% were Asian, 1% were Black or African American, and\n1% were race unknown; 45% had ECOG PS 0 and 55% had ECOG PS 1; 34% received at\nleast one prior anti-cancer systemic therapy; 81% received prior cancer-related surgery;\nand 68% received prior radiotherapy. Among patients with mCSCC, 77% had distant\nmetastases and 23% had only nodal metastases.\nFor the responding patients presented in Table 10 below, the median time to response\nwas 2.1 months (range: 1.7 to 22.8 months).\nEfficacy results based on the final analysis of Study 1540 are presented in Table 10.\nTable 10: Efficacy Results for Study 1540 in CSCC\nEfficacy Endpoints\nMetastatic\nCSCC\nLIBTAYO 3\nmg/kg\nevery 2\nweeks\n(Group 1)\nLocally\nAdvanced\nCSCC\nLIBTAYO\n3 mg/kg\nevery 2\nweeks\n(Group 2)\nMetastatic\nCSCC\nLIBTAYO\n350 mg\nevery 3\nweeks\n(Group 3)\nCombined\nCSCC\nN = 59\nN = 78\nN = 56\nN = 193\nCI: confidence interval; NR: not reached\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\nConfirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) (%)\n  ORR (95% CI)\n51 (37, 64)\n45 (34,\n57)\n46 (33, 60) 47 (40, 54)\n  Complete response rate\n20\n13\n20\n17\n  Partial response rate\n31\n32\n27\n30\nDuration of Response (DOR)\n  Number of Responders\nN = 30\nN = 35\nN = 26\nN = 91\n  Median DOR in months\n(Range)\nNR (2.8 \u2013\n38.9)\n42 (1.9 \u2013\n54.6)\n41 (4.2 \u2013\n46.3)\n41 (1.9 \u2013\n54.6)\n  Patients with observed\nDOR \u2265 6 months, n (%)\n28 (93%)\n31 (89%)\n25 (96%)\n84 (92%)\n  Patients with observed\nDOR \u2265 12 months, n (%)\n23 (77%)\n24 (69%)\n23 (88%)\n70 (77%)\nStudy 1423\nAmong 26 CSCC patients in Study 1423, 16 had mCSCC and 10 had laCSCC.

The median time to response was 1.9 months\n(range: 1.7 to 7.3 months) and 85% of responders had a DOR \u2265 6 months.\n14.2 Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)\nThe efficacy of LIBTAYO in 138 patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC)\n[unresectable locally advanced (laBCC) or metastatic (nodal or distant) (mBCC)] who had\nprogressed on hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI) therapy, had not had an objective\nresponse after 9 months on HHI therapy, or were intolerant of prior HHI therapy was\nevaluated in Study 1620 (NCT03132636), an open-label, multi-center, non-randomized\nstudy. The study excluded patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic\ntherapy with immunosuppressant agents within 5 years; history of solid organ\ntransplant; prior treatment with anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 therapy or other immune checkpoint\ninhibitor therapy; infection with HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C; or ECOG performance\nscore (PS) \u2265 2.\nPatients received LIBTAYO 350 mg every 3 weeks for up to 93 weeks until disease\nprogression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of planned treatment. Tumor\nassessments were performed every 9 weeks for the first 45 weeks of treatment and\nevery 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed\nobjective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as assessed by\nindependent central review (ICR). For patients with mBCC without externally visible\ntarget lesions, ORR was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors\n(RECIST 1.1). For patients with externally visible target lesions (laBCC and mBCC), ORR\nwas determined by a composite endpoint that integrated ICR assessments of radiologic\ndata (RECIST 1.1) and digital medical photography (WHO criteria).\nA total of 138 patients with advanced BCC were included in the efficacy analysis of Study\n1620. Of these, 39% had mBCC and 61% had laBCC. In patients with laBCC, the median\nage was 70 years (42 to 89 years); 67% were male; 68% were White and 32% were race\nnot reported/unknown; 61% had ECOG PS 0 and 39% had ECOG PS 1; 83% had\nreceived at least 1 prior cancer-related surgery; and 50% had received prior\nradiotherapy.

Patients\nwere eligible regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression status.\nPatients with EGFR, ALK or ROS1 genomic tumor aberrations; a medical condition that\nrequired systemic immunosuppression; or ongoing or recent autoimmune disease that\nrequired systemic therapy were ineligible. Patients with a history of brain metastases\nwere eligible if they had been adequately treated and had neurologically returned to\nbaseline for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization.\nRandomization was stratified by histology (non-squamous vs squamous) and PD-L1\nexpression (<1% versus 1% to 49% versus \u2265 50%) according to the VENTANA PD-L1\n(SP263) assay. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either:\nLIBTAYO 350 mg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks for 108 weeks plus platinum-\nbased chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, or\nplacebo IV every 3 weeks for 108 weeks plus platinum-based chemotherapy every 3\nweeks for 4 cycles.\nPlatinum-based chemotherapy in either arm consisted of carboplatin AUC of 5 or 6 and\npaclitaxel 200 mg/m ; cisplatin 75 mg/m  and paclitaxel 200 mg/m ; carboplatin AUC of\n5 or 6 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m ; or cisplatin 75 mg/m  and pemetrexed 500 mg/m .\nMaintenance pemetrexed was mandatory for patients with non-squamous NSCLC who\nreceived a pemetrexed-containing chemotherapy regimen in the first 4 treatment cycles.\nStudy treatment continued until RECIST 1.1-defined progressive disease, unacceptable\ntoxicity, or 108 weeks. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks\nduring year 1 and every 12 weeks after year 1.

ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 4.8% of patients treated with\nTABRECTA in GEOMETRY mono-1, with 1.9% of patients experiencing Grade 3\nILD/pneumonitis and one patient experiencing death (0.3%). Nine patients (2.4%)\ndiscontinued TABRECTA due to ILD/pneumonitis. The median time-to-onset of Grade 3\nor higher ILD/pneumonitis was 1.8 months (range: 0.2 months to 1.7 years).\nMonitor for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g.,\ndyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold TABRECTA in patients with suspected\nILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue if no other potential causes of\nILD/pneumonitis are identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.2     Hepatotoxicity\nHepatotoxicity occurred in patients treated with TABRECTA [see Adverse Reactions\n(6.1)]. Increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST)\noccurred in 15% of patients treated with TABRECTA in GEOMETRY mono-1. Grade 3 or 4\nincreased ALT/AST occurred in 7% of patients. Three patients (0.8%) discontinued\nTABRECTA due to increased ALT/AST. The median time-to-onset of Grade 3 or higher\nincreased ALT/AST was 1.8 months (range: 0.5 to 46.4 months).\nMonitor liver function tests (including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin) prior to the start of\nTABRECTA, every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month or\nas clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop increased\ntransaminases or bilirubin. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold, dose\nreduce, or permanently discontinue TABRECTA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.3     Pancreatic Toxicity\nElevations in amylase and lipase levels occurred in patients treated with TABRECTA [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)]. Increased amylase/lipase occurred in 14% of patients treated\nwith TABRECTA in GEOMETRY mono-1. Grade 3 and 4 increased amylase/lipase occurred\nin 7% and 1.9% of patients, respectively. Three patients (0.8%) discontinued TABRECTA\ndue to increased amylase/lipase. The median time-to-onset of Grade 3 or higher\nincreased amylase/lipase was 2 months (range: 0.03 to 31.1 months). Pancreatitis\n(Grade 3) occurred in one patient (0.3%); TABRECTA was permanently discontinued for\nthis event.\nMonitor amylase and lipase at baseline and regularly during treatment with TABRECTA.\nBased on the severity of the adverse reaction, temporarily withhold, dose reduce, or\npermanently discontinue TABRECTA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.4     Hypersensitivity Reactions\nSerious hypersensitivity reactions occurred in patients treated with TABRECTA in clinical\ntrials other than GEOMETRY mono-1 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Signs and symptoms\nof hypersensitivity included pyrexia, chills, pruritus, rash, decreased blood pressure,\nnausea and vomiting. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, temporarily\nwithhold or permanently discontinue TABRECTA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.5     Risk of Photosensitivity\nBased on findings from animal studies, there is a potential risk of photosensitivity\nreactions with TABRECTA [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]. In GEOMETRY mono-1, it\nwas recommended that patients use precautionary measures against ultraviolet\nexposure such as use of sunscreen or protective clothing during treatment with\nTABRECTA. Advise patients to limit direct ultraviolet exposure during treatment with\nTABRECTA.\n5.6     Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, TABRECTA can\ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Oral administration of\ncapmatinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in\nmalformations at exposures less than the human exposure based on area under the\ncurve (AUC) at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose. Advise pregnant women of the\npotential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective\ncontraception during treatment with TABRECTA and for 1 week after the last dose.\nAdvise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective\ncontraception during treatment with TABRECTA and for 1 week after the last dose [see\nUse in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].\n6     ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the\nlabeling:\nILD/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nHepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nPancreatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\nHypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]\n6.1     Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nMetastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\nThe safety of TABRECTA was evaluated in GEOMETRY mono-1 [see Clinical Studies (14)].\nPatients received TABRECTA 400 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or\nunacceptable toxicity (N = 373). Among patients who received TABRECTA, 37% were\nexposed for at least 6 months and 22% were exposed for at least one year.\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 53% of patients who received TABRECTA. Serious\nadverse reactions in \u2265 2% of patients included dyspnea (7%), pneumonia (7%), pleural\neffusion (4.3%), musculoskeletal pain (3.8%), general physical health deterioration\n(2.9%), ILD/pneumonitis (2.7%), edema (2.4%), and vomiting (2.4%). Fatal adverse\nreactions occurred in 0.5% of patients who received TABRECTA, including pneumonitis\n(0.3%) and death, not otherwise specified (0.3%).\nPermanent discontinuation of TABRECTA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 17% of\npatients. The most frequent adverse reactions (\u2265 1%) leading to permanent\ndiscontinuation of TABRECTA were ILD/pneumonitis (2.4%), edema (2.4%), fatigue\n(1.3%), and pneumonia (1.1%).\nDose interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 57% of patients who received\nTABRECTA. Adverse reactions requiring dosage interruption in > 2% of patients who\nreceived TABRECTA included edema, increased blood creatinine, nausea, increased\nlipase, vomiting, increased ALT, dyspnea, pneumonia, fatigue, increased amylase,\nincreased AST, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, and increased blood bilirubin.\nDose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 26% of patients who received\nTABRECTA. Adverse reactions requiring dosage reductions in > 2% of patients who\nreceived TABRECTA included edema, increased ALT and increased blood creatinine.\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) in patients who received TABRECTA were\nedema, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, vomiting, dyspnea, cough, and decreased\nappetite.\nTable 3 summarizes the adverse reactions in GEOMETRY mono-1.\nTable 3: Adverse Reactions (\u2265 10%) in Patients Who Received TABRECTA in\nGEOMETRY mono-1\nAdverse reactions\nTABRECTA\n(N = 373)\nGrades 1 to 4\n(%)\nGrades 3 to 4 \n(%)\nGeneral disorders and administration-site conditions\n     Edema\n59\n13\n     Musculoskeletal pain\n40\n4.3\n     Fatigue\n34\n8\na\nb\nc\nd\nEdema includes edema peripheral, generalized edema, face edema, edema, localized\nedema, edema genital, eyelid edema, peripheral swelling, scrotal edema, and penile\nedema.\nMusculoskeletal pain includes arthralgia, back pain, bone pain, musculoskeletal chest\npain, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, neck pain, non-cardiac chest pain, pain in extremity,\npain in jaw, spinal pain.\nFatigue includes fatigue and asthenia.\nPyrexia includes pyrexia and body temperature increased.\nCough includes cough, upper airway cough syndrome, and productive cough.\nPneumonia includes pneumonia aspiration, pneumonia, pneumonia influenzal,\npneumonia bacterial, lower respiratory tract infection, and lung abscess.\nRash includes rash, dermatitis acneiform, rash maculo-papular, eczema, erythema\nmultiforme, rash macular, dermatitis, rash erythematous, rash pustular, dermatitis\nbullous, and rash vesicular.\nDizziness includes dizziness, vertigo, and vertigo positional.\n     Pyrexia\n14\n0.8\n     Weight decreased\n11\n0.5\nGastrointestinal disorders\n     Nausea\n46\n2.4\n     Vomiting\n28\n2.4\n     Constipation\n19\n0.8\n     Diarrhea\n19\n0.5\nRespiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders\n     Dyspnea\n25\n7\n     Cough\n21\n0.5\n     Pneumonia\n13\n6\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\n     Decreased appetite\n21\n1.1\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\n     Rash\n13\n0.5\nNervous system disorders\n     Dizziness\n13\n0.5\nClinically relevant adverse reactions occurring in < 10% of patients treated with\nTABRECTA included pruritus (including allergic pruritus), ILD/pneumonitis, cellulitis, acute\nkidney injury (including renal failure), urticaria, and acute pancreatitis.\nTable 4 summarizes the laboratory abnormalities in GEOMETRY mono-1.\nTable 4: Select Laboratory Abnormalities (\u2265 20%) Worsening From Baseline in\nPatients Who Received TABRECTA in GEOMETRY mono-1\nLaboratory abnormalities\nTABRECTA\nGrades 1 to 4\n(%)\nGrades 3 to 4\n(%)\nChemistry\n     Decreased albumin\n72\n1.9\n     Increased creatinine\n65\n0.5\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\ng\nh\nd\ne\nf\ng\nh\na\nThe denominator used to calculate the rate varied from 359 to 364 based on the\nnumber of patients with a baseline value and at least one post-treatment value.\n     Increased alanine aminotransferase\n39\n9\n     Increased amylase\n34\n4.7\n     Increased alkaline phosphatase\n32\n0.6\n     Increased gamma-\nglutamyltransferase\n30\n6\n     Increased lipase\n29\n9\n     Increased aspartate\naminotransferase\n28\n6\n     Decreased phosphate\n26\n4.4\n     Increased potassium\n25\n4.1\n     Decreased sodium\n24\n6\n     Decreased glucose\n23\n0.3\nHematology\n     Decreased lymphocytes\n45\n14\n     Decreased leukocytes\n25\n1.7\n     Decreased hemoglobin\n24\n2.8\nOther Clinical Trials Experience\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported following administration of\nTABRECTA: hypersensitivity and thrombocytopenia.\n7     DRUG INTERACTIONS\n7.1     Effect of Other Drugs on TABRECTA\nStrong CYP3A Inhibitors\nCoadministration of TABRECTA with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increased capmatinib\nexposure, which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of\nTABRECTA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Closely monitor patients for adverse\nreactions during coadministration of TABRECTA with strong CYP3A inhibitors.\nStrong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers\nCoadministration of TABRECTA with a strong CYP3A inducer decreased capmatinib\nexposure. Coadministration of TABRECTA with a moderate CYP3A inducer may also\ndecrease capmatinib exposure. Decreases in capmatinib exposure may decrease\nTABRECTA anti-tumor activity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid coadministration\nof TABRECTA with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers.\n7.2     Effect of TABRECTA on Other Drugs\nCYP1A2 Substrates\nCoadministration of TABRECTA increased the exposure of a CYP1A2 substrate, which\nmay increase the adverse reactions of these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology\n(12.3)].

If coadministration is unavoidable between TABRECTA and P-gp\nor BCRP substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse\nreactions, decrease the P-gp or BCRP substrate dosage in accordance with the\napproved prescribing information.\nMATE1 and MATE2K Substrates\nCoadministration of TABRECTA may increase the exposure of MATE1 and MATE2K\nsubstrates, which may increase the adverse reactions of these substrates [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.3)]. If coadministration is unavoidable between TABRECTA and MATE1\nor MATE2K substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious\nadverse reactions, decrease the MATE1 or MATE2K substrate dosage in accordance with\nthe approved prescribing information.\n8     USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1     Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.1)], TABRECTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a\npregnant woman. There are no available data on TABRECTA use in pregnant women.\nOral administration of capmatinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of\norganogenesis resulted in malformations at maternal exposures less than the human\nexposure based on AUC at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose (see Data). Advise\npregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nIn rats, maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain and food consumption) occurred at\n30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.4 times the human exposure based on AUC at the 400\nmg twice daily clinical dose). Fetal effects included reduced fetal weights,\nirregular/incomplete ossification, and increased incidences of fetal malformations (e.g.,\nabnormal flexure/inward malrotation of hindpaws/forepaws, thinness of forelimbs, lack\nof/reduced flexion at the humerus/ulna joints, and narrowed or small tongue) at doses\nof \u2265 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.6 times the human exposure based on AUC at the\n400 mg twice daily clinical dose).\nIn rabbits, no maternal effects were detected at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day\n(approximately 1.5 times the human exposure based on AUC at the 400 mg twice daily\nclinical dose). Fetal effects included small lung lobe at \u2265 5 mg/kg/day (approximately\n0.016 times the human exposure based on AUC at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose),\nand reduced fetal weights, irregular/incomplete ossification and increased incidences of\nfetal malformations (e.g., abnormal flexure/malrotation of hindpaws/forepaws, thinness\nof forelimbs/hindlimbs, lack of/reduced flexion at the humerus/ulna joints, small lung\nlobes, narrowed or small tongue) at the dose of 60 mg/kg/day.\n8.2     Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of capmatinib or its metabolites in either human or\nanimal milk or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the\npotential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to\nbreastfeed during treatment with TABRECTA and for 1 week after the last dose.\n8.3     Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nBased on animal data, TABRECTA can cause malformations at doses less than the\nhuman exposure based on AUC at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.1)].\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify pregnancy status for females of reproductive potential prior to starting treatment\nwith TABRECTA.\nContraception\nFemales\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment\nwith TABRECTA and for 1 week after the last dose.\nMales\nAdvise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective\ncontraception during treatment with TABRECTA and for 1 week after the last dose.\n8.4     Pediatric Use\nSafety and effectiveness of TABRECTA in pediatric patients have not been established.\n8.5     Geriatric Use\nIn GEOMETRY mono-1, 61% of the 373 patients were 65 years or older and 18% were\n75 years or older. No overall differences in the safety or effectiveness were observed\nbetween these patients and younger patients.\n8.6     Renal Impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (baseline creatinine\nclearance [CLcr] 60 to 89 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault) or moderate renal impairment\n(CLcr 30 to 59 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. TABRECTA has not been\nstudied in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min).\n11     DESCRIPTION\nCapmatinib is a kinase inhibitor. The chemical name is 2-Fluoro-N-methyl-4-[7-(quinolin-6-\nylmethyl)imidazo[1,2-b][1,2,4]triazin-2-yl]benzamide\u2014hydrogen chloride\u2014water (1/2/1).\nThe molecular formula for capmatinib dihydrochloride monohydrate is C\nH\nCl FN O .\nThe relative molecular mass is 503.36 g/mol for the dihydrochloride monohydrate salt\nand 412.43 g/mol for the free base. The chemical structure for capmatinib\ndihydrochloride monohydrate is shown below:\nCapmatinib dihydrochloride monohydrate is a yellow powder with a pKa  of 0.9\n(calculated) and pKa  of 4.5 (experimentally). Capmatinib dihydrochloride monohydrate\nis slightly soluble in acidic aqueous solutions at pH 1 and 2 and of further decreasing\nsolubility towards neutral condition. The log of the distribution coefficient (n-\noctanol/acetate buffer pH 4.0) is 1.2.\nTABRECTA is supplied for oral use as ovaloid, curved film-coated tablets with beveled\nedges, unscored containing 150 mg (pale orange brown color) or 200 mg (yellow color)\ncapmatinib (equivalent to 183.00 mg or 244.00 mg respectively of capmatinib\ndihydrochloride monohydrate). Each tablet strength contains colloidal silicon dioxide;\ncrospovidone; magnesium stearate; mannitol; microcrystalline cellulose; povidone; and\nsodium lauryl sulfate as inactive ingredients.\nThe 150 mg tablet coating contains ferric oxide, red; ferric oxide, yellow; ferrosoferric\noxide; hypromellose; polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000; talc; and titanium dioxide. The 200\nmg tablet coating contains ferric oxide, yellow; hypromellose; polyethylene glycol (PEG)\n4000; talc; and titanium dioxide.\n12     CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1     Mechanism of Action\nCapmatinib is a kinase inhibitor that targets MET, including the mutant variant produced\nby exon 14 skipping. MET exon 14 skipping results in a protein with a missing regulatory\ndomain that reduces its negative regulation leading to increased downstream MET\nsignaling. Capmatinib inhibited cancer cell growth driven by a mutant MET variant lacking\nexon 14 at clinically achievable concentrations and demonstrated anti-tumor activity in\nmurine tumor xenograft models derived from human lung tumors with either a mutation\nleading to MET exon 14 skipping or MET amplification. Capmatinib inhibited the\nphosphorylation of MET triggered by binding of hepatocyte growth factor or by MET\n23\n21\n2\n6\n2\n1\n2\namplification, as well as MET-mediated phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins\nand proliferation and survival of MET-dependent cancer cells.\n12.2     Pharmacodynamics\nExposure-Response\nCapmatinib exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamics\nresponse are unknown.\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nNo large mean increase in QTc (i.e. > 20 ms) was detected following treatment with\nTABRECTA at the recommended dosage of 400 mg orally twice daily.\n12.3     Pharmacokinetics\nCapmatinib exposure (AUC\n and C\n) increased approximately proportionally over\na dose range of 200 mg (0.5 times the recommended dosage) to 400 mg. Capmatinib\nreached steady-state by day 3 following twice daily dosing, with a mean (% coefficient of\nvariation [%CV]) accumulation ratio of 1.5 (41%).\nAbsorption\nAfter administration of TABRECTA 400 mg orally in patients with cancer, capmatinib peak\nplasma concentrations (C\n) were reached in approximately 1 to 2 hours (T\n). The\nabsorption of capmatinib after oral administration is estimated to be greater than 70%.\nEffect of Food\nA high-fat meal (containing approximately 1000 calories and 50% fat) in healthy subjects\nincreased capmatinib AUC\n by 46% with no change in C\n compared to under\nfasted conditions. A low-fat meal (containing approximately 300 calories and 20% fat) in\nhealthy subjects had no clinically meaningful effect on capmatinib exposure. When\ncapmatinib was administered at 400 mg orally twice daily in cancer patients, exposure\n(AUC\n) was similar after administration of capmatinib with food and under fasted\nconditions.\nDistribution\nCapmatinib plasma protein binding is 96%, independent of capmatinib concentration. The\napparent mean volume of distribution at steady-state is 164 L.\nThe blood-to-plasma ratio was 1.5, but decreased at higher concentrations to 0.9.\nElimination\nThe effective elimination half-life of capmatinib is 6.5 hours. The mean (%CV) steady-\nstate apparent clearance of capmatinib is 24 L/hr (82%).\nMetabolism\nCapmatinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and aldehyde oxidase.\nExcretion\nFollowing a single oral administration of radiolabeled-capmatinib to healthy subjects, 78%\nof the total radioactivity was recovered in feces with 42% as unchanged and 22% was\nrecovered in urine with negligible as unchanged.\n0-12h\nmax\nmax\nmax\n0-INF\nmax\n0-12h\nSpecific Populations\nNo clinically significant effects on the pharmacokinetic parameters of capmatinib were\nidentified for the following covariates assessed: age (26 to 90 years), sex, race (White,\nAsian, Native American, Black, unknown), body weight (35 to 131 kg), mild to moderate\nrenal impairment (baseline CLcr 30 to 89 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault) and mild, moderate\nor severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification). The effect of severe renal\nimpairment (baseline CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min) on capmatinib pharmacokinetics has not\nbeen studied.\nDrug Interaction Studies\nClinical Studies and Model-Informed Approaches\nStrong CYP3A Inhibitors: Coadministration with itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor)\nincreased capmatinib AUC\n by 42% with no change in capmatinib C\n.\nStrong CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with rifampicin (a strong CYP3A inducer)\ndecreased capmatinib AUC\n by 67% and decreased C\n by 56%.\nModerate CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with efavirenz (a moderate CYP3A inducer)\nwas predicted to decrease capmatinib AUC\n by 44% and decrease C\n by 34%.\nProton Pump Inhibitors: Coadministration with rabeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor)\ndecreased capmatinib AUC\n by 25% and decreased C\n by 38%.\nSubstrates of CYP Enzymes: Coadministration of capmatinib increased caffeine (a\nCYP1A2 substrate) AUC\n by 134% with no change in its C\n. Coadministration of\ncapmatinib had no clinically meaningful effect on exposure of midazolam (a CYP3A\nsubstrate).\nP-gp Substrates: Coadministration of capmatinib increased digoxin (a P-gp substrate)\nAUC\n by 47% and increased C\n by 74%.\nBCRP Substrates: Coadministration of capmatinib increased rosuvastatin (a BCRP\nsubstrate) AUC\n by 108% and increased C\n by 204%.\nIn Vitro Studies\nTransporter Systems: Capmatinib is a substrate of P-gp, but not a substrate of BCRP or\nMRP2. Capmatinib reversibly inhibits MATE1 and MATE2K, but does not inhibit OATP1B1,\nOATP1B3, OCT1, OAT1, OAT3, or MRP2.\n13     NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1     Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies were not conducted with capmatinib. Capmatinib was not\nmutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay and did not cause\nchromosomal aberrations in an in vitro chromosome aberration assay in human\nperipheral blood lymphocytes. Capmatinib was not clastogenic in an in vivo bone marrow\nmicronucleus test in rats.\nDedicated fertility studies were not conducted with capmatinib. No effects on male and\nfemale reproductive organs occurred in general toxicology studies conducted in rats\n0-INF\nmax\n0-INF\nmax\n0-12h\nmax\n0-INF\nmax\n0-INF\nmax\n0-INF\nmax\n0-INF\nmax\nand monkeys at doses resulting in exposures of up to approximately 3.6 times the\nhuman exposure based on AUC at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose.\n13.2     Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nIn rats, capmatinib administration resulted in vacuolation of white matter of the brain in\nboth 4- and 13-week studies at doses \u2265 2.2 times the human exposure (AUC) at the\n400 mg twice daily clinical dose. In some cases, the brain lesions were associated with\nearly death and/or convulsions or tremors. Concentrations of capmatinib in the brain\ntissue of rats was approximately 9% of the corresponding concentrations in plasma.\nIn vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that capmatinib has some potential for\nphotosensitization; however, the no-observed-adverse-effect level for in vivo\nphotosensitization was 30 mg/kg/day (C\n of 14000 ng/mL), about 2.9 times the\nhuman C\n at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose.\n14     CLINICAL STUDIES\nMetastatic NSCLC with a Mutation that Leads to MET Exon 14 Skipping\nThe efficacy of TABRECTA was evaluated in GEOMETRY mono-1, a multicenter, non-\nrandomized, open-label, multi-cohort study (NCT02414139). Eligible patients were\nrequired to have NSCLC with a mutation that leads to MET exon 14 skipping, epidermal\ngrowth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) negative\nstatus, and at least one measurable lesion as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in\nSolid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases, clinically\nsignificant uncontrolled cardiac disease, or who received treatment with any MET or\nhepatocyte growth factor (HGF) inhibitor were not eligible for the study.\nOut of the first 97 patients enrolled in GEOMETRY mono-1 following the central\nconfirmation of MET exon 14 skipping by a RNA-based clinical trial assay, 78 patient\nsamples were retested with the FDA-approved FoundationOne  CDx (22 treatment-\nna\u00efve and 56 previously treated patients) to detect mutations that lead to MET exon 14\nskipping. Out of 78 samples retested with FoundationOne  CDx, 73 samples were\nevaluable (20 treatment-na\u00efve and 53 previously treated patients), 72 (20 treatment-\nna\u00efve and 52 previously treated patients) of which were confirmed to have a mutation\nthat leads to MET exon 14 skipping, demonstrating an estimated positive percentage\nagreement of 99% (72/73) between the clinical trial assay and the FDA-approved assay.\nPatients received TABRECTA 400 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or\nunacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate\n(ORR) as determined by a Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) according to\nRECIST 1.1. An additional efficacy outcome measure was duration of response (DOR) by\nBIRC.\nThe efficacy population included 60 treatment-na\u00efve patients and 100 previously treated\npatients. The median age was 71 years (range: 48 to 90 years); 61% female; 77% White;\n25% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) 0 and\n74% had ECOG PS 1; 61% never smoked; 83% had adenocarcinoma; and 16% had CNS\nmetastases. Among previously treated patients, 81% received one, 16% received two\nand 3% received three prior lines of systemic therapy. Amongst previously treated\npatients, 86% received prior platinum-based chemotherapy.\nmax\nmax\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\nEfficacy results are presented in Table 5.\nTable 5: Efficacy Results for Treatment-Na\u00efve and Previously Treated\nPatients in GEOMETRY mono-1\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; NE, not estimable.\nBlinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) review.\nConfirmed response.\nClopper and Pearson exact binomial 95% CI.\nBased on Kaplan-Meier estimate.\nEfficacy parameters\nTreatment-na\u00efve\nN = 60\nPreviously treated\nN = 100\nOverall response rate\n (95%\nCI)\n68% (55, 80)\n44% (34, 54)\n     Complete response\n5%\n0\n     Partial response\n63%\n44%\nDuration of response (DOR)\n     Median (months) (95% CI)\n16.6 (8.4, 22.1)\n9.7 (5.6, 13.0)\n     Patients % with DOR \u2265 12\nmonths\n49%\n36%\n16     HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING\nHow Supplied\nTABRECTA (capmatinib) 150 mg and 200 mg tablets\nStrength\nDescription\nTablets per\nbottle\nNDC number\n150 mg\nPale orange brown, ovaloid,\ncurved film-coated tablet with\nbeveled edges, unscored,\ndebossed with \u2018DU\u2019 on one side\nand \u2018NVR\u2019 on the other side.\n56\n0078-0709-56\n200 mg\nYellow, ovaloid, curved film-\ncoated tablet with beveled edges,\nunscored, debossed with \u2018LO\u2019 on\none side and \u2018NVR\u2019 on the other\nside.\n56\n0078-0716-56\nStorage\nDispense in the original package with the desiccant cartridge.

Withhold\nVIZIMPRO and promptly investigate for ILD in patients who present with worsening of\nrespiratory symptoms which may be indicative of ILD (e.g., dyspnea, cough, and fever).\nPermanently discontinue VIZIMPRO if ILD is confirmed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n5.2 Diarrhea\nSevere and fatal diarrhea occurred in patients treated with VIZIMPRO. Diarrhea occurred\nin 86% of the 394 VIZIMPRO-treated patients; Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea was reported in\n11% of patients and 0.3% of cases were fatal.\nWithhold VIZIMPRO for Grade 2 or greater diarrhea until recovery to less than or equal\nto Grade 1 severity, then resume VIZIMPRO at the same or a reduced dose depending\non the severity of diarrhea [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions\n(6.1)]. Promptly initiate anti-diarrheal treatment (loperamide or diphenoxylate\nhydrochloride with atropine sulfate) for diarrhea.\n5.3 Dermatologic Adverse Reactions\nRash and exfoliative skin reactions occurred in patients treated with VIZIMPRO. Rash\noccurred in 78% of the 394 VIZIMPRO-treated patients; Grade 3 or 4 rash was reported\nin 21% of patients. Exfoliative skin reactions of any severity were reported in 7% of\npatients. Grade 3 or 4 exfoliative skin reactions were reported in 1.8% of patients.\nWithhold VIZIMPRO for persistent Grade 2 or any Grade 3 or 4 dermatologic adverse\nreaction until recovery to less than or equal to Grade 1 severity, then resume VIZIMPRO\nat the same or a reduced dose depending on the severity of the dermatologic adverse\nreaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The\nincidence and severity of rash and exfoliative skin reactions may increase with sun\nexposure. At the time of initiation of VIZIMPRO, initiate use of moisturizers and\nappropriate measures to limit sun exposure. Upon development of Grade 1 rash, initiate\ntreatment with topical antibiotics and topical steroids. Initiate oral antibiotics for Grade 2\nor more severe dermatologic adverse reactions.\n5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, VIZIMPRO can\ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction\nstudies, oral administration of dacomitinib to pregnant rats during the period of\norganogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of post-implantation loss and reduced\nfetal body weight at doses resulting in exposures near the exposure at the 45 mg\nhuman dose. The absence of EGFR signaling has been shown to result in embryolethality\nas well as post-natal death in animals. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to\nthe fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during\ntreatment with VIZIMPRO and for at least 17 days after the final dose [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.1 and 8.3)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse drug reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe data in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to VIZIMPRO in 394\npatients with first-line or previously treated NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon\n21 L858R substitution mutations who received VIZIMPRO at the recommended dose of\n45 mg once daily in 4 randomized, active-controlled trials [ARCHER 1050 (N=227), Study\nA7471009 (N=38), Study A7471011 (N=83), and Study A7471028 (N=16)] and one\nsingle-arm trial [Study A7471017 (N=30)]. The median duration of exposure to\nVIZIMPRO was 10.8 months (range 0.07\u201368) [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].\nThe data described below reflect exposure to VIZIMPRO in 227 patients with EGFR\nmutation-positive, metastatic NSCLC enrolled in a randomized, active-controlled trial\n(ARCHER 1050); 224 patients received gefitinib 250 mg orally once daily in the active\ncontrol arm [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Patients were excluded if they had a history of\nILD, interstitial pneumonitis, or brain metastases. The median duration of exposure to\nVIZIMPRO was 15 months (range 0.07\u201337).\nThe most common (>20%) adverse reactions in patients treated with VIZIMPRO were\ndiarrhea (87%), rash (69%), paronychia (64%), stomatitis (45%), decreased appetite\n(31%), dry skin (30%), decreased weight (26%), alopecia (23%), cough (21%), and\npruritus (21%).\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 27% of patients treated with VIZIMPRO. The most\ncommon (\u22651%) serious adverse reactions were diarrhea (2.2%) and interstitial lung\ndisease (1.3%). Dose interruptions occurred in 57% of patients treated with VIZIMPRO.\nThe most frequent (>5%) adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions were rash\n(23%), paronychia (13%), and diarrhea (10%). Dose reductions occurred in 66% of\npatients treated with VIZIMPRO. The most frequent (>5%) adverse reactions leading to\ndose reductions were rash (29%), paronychia (17%), and diarrhea (8%).\nAdverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of VIZIMPRO occurred in 18%\nof patients. The most common (>0.5%) adverse reactions leading to permanent\ndiscontinuation of VIZIMPRO were: rash (2.6%), interstitial lung disease (1.8%),\nstomatitis (0.9%), and diarrhea (0.9%).\nTables 3 and 4 summarize the most common adverse reactions and laboratory\nabnormalities, respectively, in ARCHER 1050. ARCHER 1050 was not designed to\ndemonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reaction rates for VIZIMPRO\nor for gefitinib for any adverse reaction or laboratory value listed in Table 3 or 4.\nTable 3.

Avoid the concomitant use of PPIs with VIZIMPRO. As an alternative\nto PPIs, use locally-acting antacids or an H2-receptor antagonist. Administer VIZIMPRO\nat least 6 hours before or 10 hours after taking an H2-receptor antagonist [see Dosage\nand Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n7.2 Effect of VIZIMPRO on CYP2D6 Substrates\nConcomitant use of VIZIMPRO increases the concentration of drugs that are CYP2D6\nsubstrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] which may increase the risk of toxicities of\nthese drugs. Avoid concomitant use of VIZIMPRO with CYP2D6 substrates where\nminimal increases in concentration of the CYP2D6 substrate may lead to serious or life-\nthreatening toxicities.\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, VIZIMPRO can\ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology\n(12.1)]. There are no available data on VIZIMPRO use in pregnant women. In animal\nreproduction studies, oral administration of dacomitinib to pregnant rats during the\nperiod of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of post-implantation loss and\nreduced fetal body weight at doses resulting in exposures near the exposure at the 45\nmg human dose (see Data). The absence of EGFR signaling has been shown to result in\nembryolethality as well as post-natal death in animals (see Data). Advise pregnant\nwomen of the potential risk to a fetus [see Use in Special Populations (8.3)].\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nDaily oral administration of dacomitinib to pregnant rats during the period of\norganogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of post-implantation loss, maternal\ntoxicity, and reduced fetal body weight at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.2 times the\nexposure based on area under the curve [AUC] at the 45 mg human dose).\nDisruption or depletion of EGFR in mouse models has shown EGFR is critically important\nin reproductive and developmental processes including blastocyst implantation, placental\ndevelopment, and embryo-fetal/post-natal survival and development. Reduction or\nelimination of embryo-fetal or maternal EGFR signaling in mice can prevent implantation,\nand can cause embryo-fetal loss during various stages of gestation (through effects on\nplacental development), developmental anomalies, early death in surviving fetuses, and\nadverse developmental outcomes in multiple organs in embryos/neonates.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere is no information regarding the presence of dacomitinib or its metabolites in\nhuman milk or their effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Because of\nthe potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from VIZIMPRO, advise\nwomen not to breastfeed during treatment with VIZIMPRO and for at least 17 days after\nthe last dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating\nVIZIMPRO [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nContraception\nVIZIMPRO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.1)].\nFemales\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment\nwith VIZIMPRO and for at least 17 days after the final dose.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of VIZIMPRO in pediatrics have not been established.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the total number of patients (N=394) in five clinical studies with EGFR mutation-\npositive NSCLC who received VIZIMPRO at a dose of 45 mg orally once daily [ARCHER\n1050 (N=227), Study A7471009 (N=38), Study A7471011 (N=83), Study A7471028\n(N=16), and Study A7471017 (N=30)] 40% were 65 years of age and older.\nExploratory analyses across this population suggest a higher incidence of Grade 3 and 4\nadverse reactions (67% versus 56%, respectively), more frequent dose interruptions\n(53% versus 45%, respectively), and more frequent discontinuations (24% versus 10%,\nrespectively) for adverse reactions in patients 65 years or older as compared to those\nyounger than 65 years.\n8.6 Renal Impairment\nNo dosage modification is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal\nimpairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 30 to 89 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault).\nThe recommended dose of VIZIMPRO has not been established for patients with severe\nrenal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n8.7 Hepatic Impairment\nNo dosage modification is recommended in patients with mild, moderate or severe\nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, B or C) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n11 DESCRIPTION\nDacomitinib is an oral kinase inhibitor with a molecular formula of C\nH\nClFN O  \u2219 H O\nand a molecular weight of 487.95 Daltons. The chemical name is: (2E)-N-{4-[(3-Chloro-\n4-fluorophenyl)amino]-7-methoxyquinazolin-6-yl}-4-(piperidin-1-yl)but-2-enamide\nmonohydrate and its structural formula is:\nDacomitinib is a white to pale yellow powder.\nVIZIMPRO tablets contain 45, 30, or 15 mg of dacomitinib with the following inactive\ningredients in the tablet core; lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium\nstarch glycolate, and magnesium stearate. The film coating consists of Opadry II\n Blue\n85F30716 containing: Polyvinyl alcohol \u2013 partially hydrolyzed, Talc, Titanium dioxide,\nMacrogol/PEG 3350, and FD&C Blue #2/Indigo Carmine Aluminum Lake.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nDacomitinib is an irreversible inhibitor of the kinase activity of the human EGFR family\n(EGFR/HER1, HER2, and HER4) and certain EGFR activating mutations (exon 19 deletion\nor the exon 21 L858R substitution mutation). In vitro dacomitinib also inhibited the\nactivity of DDR1, EPHA6, LCK, DDR2, and MNK1 at clinically relevant concentrations.\nDacomitinib demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of EGFR and HER2\nautophosphorylation and tumor growth in mice bearing subcutaneously implanted\nhuman tumor xenografts driven by HER family targets including mutated EGFR.\nDacomitinib also exhibited antitumor activity in orally-dosed mice bearing intracranial\nhuman tumor xenografts driven by EGFR amplifications.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nThe effect of dacomitinib on the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) was evaluated\nusing time-matched electrocardiograms (ECGs) evaluating the change from baseline and\ncorresponding pharmacokinetic data in 32 patients with advanced NSCLC. Dacomitinib\n24\n25\n5\n2\n2\n\u00ae\nhad no large effect on QTc (i.e., >20 ms) at maximum dacomitinib concentrations\nachieved with VIZIMPRO 45 mg orally once daily.\nExposure-Response Relationships\nHigher exposures, across the range of exposures with the recommended dose of 45\nmg daily, correlated with an increased probability of Grade \u22653 adverse events,\nspecifically dermatologic toxicities and diarrhea.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe maximum dacomitinib plasma concentration (C\n) and AUC at steady state\nincreased proportionally over the dose range of VIZIMPRO 2 mg to 60 mg orally once\ndaily (0.04 to 1.3 times the recommended dose) across dacomitinib studies in patients\nwith cancer. At a dose of 45 mg orally once daily, the geometric mean [coefficient of\nvariation (CV%)] C\n was 108 ng/mL (35%) and the AUC\n was 2213 ng\u2219h/mL\n(35%) at steady state in a dose-finding clinical study conducted in patients with solid\ntumors. Steady state was achieved within 14 days following repeated dosing and the\nestimated geometric mean (CV%) accumulation ratio was 5.7 (28%) based on AUC.\nAbsorption\nThe mean absolute bioavailability of dacomitinib is 80% after oral administration. The\nmedian dacomitinib time to reach maximum concentration (T\n) occurred at\napproximately 6.0 hours (range 2.0 to 24 hours) after a single oral dose of VIZIMPRO\n45 mg in patients with cancer.\nEffect of Food\nAdministration of VIZIMPRO with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (approximately 800 to\n1000 calories with 150, 250, and 500 to 600 calories from protein, carbohydrate and\nfat, respectively) had no clinically meaningful effect on dacomitinib pharmacokinetics.\nDistribution\nThe geometric mean (CV%) volume of distribution of dacomitinib (V\n) was 1889 L\n(18%). In vitro binding of dacomitinib to human plasma proteins is approximately 98%\nand is independent of drug concentrations from 250 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL.\nElimination\nFollowing a single 45 mg oral dose of VIZIMPRO in patients with cancer, the mean (CV%)\nplasma half-life of dacomitinib was 70 hours (21%), and the geometric mean (CV%)\napparent plasma clearance of dacomitinib was 24.9 L/h (36%).\nMetabolism\nHepatic metabolism is the main route of clearance of dacomitinib, with oxidation and\nglutathione conjugation as the major pathways. Following oral administration of a single\n45 mg dose of [\nC] dacomitinib, the most abundant circulating metabolite was O-\ndesmethyl dacomitinib, which had similar in vitro pharmacologic activity as dacomitinib.\nThe steady-state plasma trough concentration of O-desmethyl dacomitinib ranges from\n7.4% to 19% of the parent. In vitro studies indicated that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6\nwas the major isozyme involved in the formation of O-desmethyl dacomitinib, while\nCYP3A4 contributed to the formation of other minor oxidative metabolites.\nExcretion\nmax\nmax\n0\u201324h\nmax\nss\n14\nFollowing a single oral 45 mg dose of [\nC] radiolabeled dacomitinib, 79% of the\nradioactivity was recovered in feces (20% as dacomitinib) and 3% in urine (<1% as\ndacomitinib).\nSpecific Populations\nPatients with Renal Impairment\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses, mild (60 mL/min \u2264 CLcr <90 mL/min;\nN=590) and moderate (30 mL/min \u2264 CLcr <60 mL/min; N=218) renal impairment did\nnot alter dacomitinib pharmacokinetics, relative to the pharmacokinetics in patients with\nnormal renal function (CLcr \u226590 mL/min; N=567). The pharmacokinetics of dacomitinib\nhas not been adequately characterized in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr\n<30 mL/min) (N=4) or studied in patients requiring hemodialysis.\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\nNo clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of dacomitinib were observed\nin subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, B or C) [see\nUse in Specific Populations (8.7)].\nDrug Interaction Studies\nClinical Studies\nEffect of Acid-Reducing Agents on Dacomitinib\nCoadministration of a single 45 mg dose of VIZIMPRO with multiple doses of rabeprazole\n(a proton pump inhibitor) decreased dacomitinib C\n by 51% and AUC\n by 39%\n[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].\nCoadministration of VIZIMPRO with a local antacid (Maalox\n Maximum Strength, 400\nmg/5 mL) did not cause clinically relevant changes dacomitinib concentrations [see\nDosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].\nThe effect of H2 receptor antagonists on dacomitinib pharmacokinetics has not been\nstudied [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].\nEffect of Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors on Dacomitinib\nCoadministration of a single 45 mg dose of VIZIMPRO with multiple doses of paroxetine\n(a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor) in healthy subjects increased the total AUC\n of dacomitinib\nplus its active metabolite (O-desmethyl dacomitinib) in plasma by approximately 6%,\nwhich is not considered clinically relevant.\nEffect of Dacomitinib on CYP2D6 Substrates\nCoadministration of a single 45 mg oral dose of VIZIMPRO increased dextromethorphan\n(a CYP2D6 substrate) C\n by 9.7-fold and AUC\n by 9.6-fold [see Drug Interactions\n(7.2)].\nIn Vitro Studies\nEffect of Dacomitinib and O-desmethyl Dacomitinib on CYP Enzymes: Dacomitinib and its\nmetabolite O-desmethyl dacomitinib do not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9,\nCYP2C19, or CYP3A4/5. Dacomitinib does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4.\nEffect of Dacomitinib on Uridine 5' diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) Enzymes:\n14\nmax\n0\u201396h\n\u00ae\nlast\nmax\nlast\nDacomitinib inhibits UGT1A1. Dacomitinib does not inhibit UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9,\nUGT2B7, or UGT2B15.\nEffect of Dacomitinib on Transporter Systems: Dacomitinib is a substrate for the\nmembrane transport protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast Cancer Resistance\nProtein (BCRP). Dacomitinib inhibits P-gp, BCRP, and organic cation transporter (OCT)1.\nDacomitinib does not inhibit organic anion transporters (OAT)1 and OAT3, OCT2, organic\nanion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, and OATP1B3.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed with VIZIMPRO.\nDacomitinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay or\nclastogenic in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay or\nclastogenic or aneugenic in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay.\nDaily oral administration of dacomitinib at doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg/day to female rats\n(approximately 0.14 times the exposure based on AUC at the 45 mg human dose)\nresulted in reversible epithelial atrophy in the cervix and vagina. Oral administration of\ndacomitinib at 2 mg/kg/day to male rats (approximately 0.6 times the human exposure\nbased on AUC at the 45 mg clinical dose) resulted in reversible decreased secretion in\nthe prostate gland.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of VIZIMPRO was demonstrated in a randomized, multicenter, multinational,\nopen-label study (ARCHER 1050; [NCT01774721]). Patients were required to have\nunresectable, metastatic NSCLC with no prior therapy for metastatic disease or\nrecurrent disease with a minimum of 12 months disease-free after completion of\nsystemic therapy; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status\nof 0 or 1; EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations. EGFR\nmutation status was prospectively determined by local laboratory or commercially\navailable tests (e.g., therascreen\n EGFR RGQ PCR and cobas\n EGFR Mutation Test).\nPatients were randomized (1:1) to receive VIZIMPRO 45 mg orally once daily or gefitinib\n250 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\nRandomization was stratified by region (Japanese versus mainland Chinese versus other\nEast Asian versus non-East Asian), and EGFR mutation status (exon 19 deletions versus\nexon 21 L858R substitution mutation). The major efficacy outcome measure was\nprogression-free survival (PFS) as determined by blinded Independent Radiologic Central\n(IRC) review per RECIST v1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures were overall\nresponse rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), and overall survival (OS).\nA total of 452 patients were randomized to receive VIZIMPRO (N=227) or gefitinib\n(N=225). The demographic characteristics were 60% female; median age 62 years\n(range: 28 to 87), with 40% aged 65 years and older; and 23% White, 77% Asian, and\nless than 1% Black. Prognostic and tumor characteristics were ECOG performance\nstatus 0 (30%) or 1 (70%); 59% with exon 19 deletion and 41% with exon 21 L858R\nsubstitution; Stage IIIB (8%) and Stage IV (92%); 64% were never smokers; and 1%\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\nreceived prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy.\nARCHER 1050 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS as determined\nby the IRC. Results are summarized in Table 5 and Figures 1 and 2.\nThe hierarchical statistical testing order was PFS followed by ORR and then OS. No\nformal testing of OS was conducted since the formal comparison of ORR was not\nstatistically significant.\nTable 5.

The overall\nincidence of ILD in approximately 32,000 TARCEVA-treated patients in uncontrolled studies and\nstudies with concurrent chemotherapy was approximately 1.1%. In patients with ILD, the onset of\nsymptoms was between 5 days to more than 9 months (median 39 days) after initiating TARCEVA\ntherapy.\nWithhold TARCEVA for acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms such as\ndyspnea, cough, and fever pending diagnostic evaluation. If ILD is confirmed, permanently discontinue\nTARCEVA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\n5.2 Renal Failure\nHepatorenal syndrome, severe acute renal failure including fatal cases, and renal insufficiency can\noccur with TARCEVA treatment. Renal failure may arise from exacerbation of underlying baseline\nhepatic impairment or severe dehydration. The pooled incidence of severe renal impairment in the 3\nmonotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.5% in the TARCEVA arms and 0.8% in the control arms. The\nincidence of renal impairment in the pancreatic cancer study was 1.4% in the TARCEVA plus\ngemcitabine arm and 0.4% in the control arm. Withhold TARCEVA in patients developing severe renal\nimpairment until renal toxicity is resolved. Perform periodic monitoring of renal function and serum\nelectrolytes during TARCEVA treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Dosage and Administration\n(2.4)].\n5.3 Hepatotoxicity with or without Hepatic Impairment\nHepatic failure and hepatorenal syndrome, including fatal cases, can occur with TARCEVA treatment in\npatients with normal hepatic function; the risk of hepatic toxicity is increased in patients with baseline\nhepatic impairment. In clinical studies where patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment were\nexcluded, the pooled incidence of hepatic failure in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.4% in\nthe TARCEVA arms and 0% in the control arms. The incidence of hepatic failure in the pancreatic\ncancer study was 0.4% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 0.4% in the control arm. In a\npharmacokinetic study in 15 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) associated with\nsignificant liver tumor burden, 10 of these 15 patients died within 30 days of the last TARCEVA dose.\nOne patient died from hepatorenal syndrome, 1 patient died from rapidly progressing liver failure and\nthe remaining 8 patients died from progressive disease. Six out of the 10 patients who died had baseline\ntotal bilirubin > 3 x ULN.\nPerform periodic liver testing (transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) during treatment with\nTARCEVA. Increased frequency of monitoring of liver function is required for patients with pre-\nexisting hepatic impairment or biliary obstruction. Withhold TARCEVA in patients without pre-existing\nhepatic impairment for total bilirubin levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal or\ntransaminases greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal. Withhold TARCEVA in patients with pre-\nexisting hepatic impairment or biliary obstruction for doubling of bilirubin or tripling of transaminases\nvalues over baseline. Discontinue TARCEVA in patients whose abnormal liver tests meeting the above\ncriteria do not improve significantly or resolve within three weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)\nand Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nand Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n5.4 Gastrointestinal Perforation\nGastrointestinal perforation, including fatal cases, can occur with TARCEVA treatment. Patients\nreceiving concomitant anti-angiogenic agents, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, or taxane-based chemotherapy,\nor who have prior history of peptic ulceration or diverticular disease may be at increased risk of\nperforation [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. The pooled incidence of gastrointestinal perforation in the\n3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.2% in the TARCEVA arms and 0.1% in the control arms. The\nincidence of gastrointestinal perforation in the pancreatic cancer study was 0.4% in the TARCEVA plus\ngemcitabine arm and 0% in the control arm. Permanently discontinue TARCEVA in patients who\ndevelop gastrointestinal perforation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\n5.5 Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Disorders\nBullous, blistering and exfoliative skin conditions, including cases suggestive of Stevens-Johnson\nsyndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, which in some cases were fatal, can occur with TARCEVA\ntreatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. The pooled incidence of bullous and exfoliative skin\ndisorders in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 1.2% in the TARCEVA arms and 0% in the\ncontrol arms. The incidence of bullous and exfoliative skin disorders in the pancreatic cancer study was\n0.4% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 0% in the control arm. Discontinue TARCEVA\ntreatment if the patient develops severe bullous, blistering or exfoliating conditions [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.4)].\n5.6 Cerebrovascular Accident\nIn the pancreatic carcinoma trial, seven patients in the TARCEVA/gemcitabine group developed\ncerebrovascular accidents (incidence: 2.5%). One of these was hemorrhagic and was the only fatal\nevent. In comparison, in the placebo/gemcitabine group there were no cerebrovascular accidents. The\npooled incidence of cerebrovascular accident in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.6% in the\nTARCEVA arms and not higher than that observed in the control arms.\n5.7 Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia with Thrombocytopenia\nThe pooled incidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia in the 3\nmonotherapy lung cancer studies was 0% in the TARCEVA arms and 0.1% in the control arms. The\nincidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia in the pancreatic cancer study\nwas 1.4% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 0% in the control arm.\n5.8 Ocular Disorders\nDecreased tear production, abnormal eyelash growth, keratoconjunctivitis sicca or keratitis can occur\nwith TARCEVA treatment and can lead to corneal perforation or ulceration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)\nand (6.2)]. The pooled incidence of ocular disorders in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was\n17.8% in the TARCEVA arms and 4% in the control arms. The incidence of ocular disorders in the\npancreatic cancer study was 12.8% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 11.4% in the control\narm. Interrupt or discontinue TARCEVA therapy if patients present with acute or worsening ocular\ndisorders such as eye pain [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\n5.9 Hemorrhage in Patients Taking Warfarin\nSevere and fatal hemorrhage associated with International Normalized Ratio (INR) elevations can occur\nwhen TARCEVA and warfarin are administered concurrently. Regularly monitor prothrombin time and\nINR during TARCEVA treatment in patients taking warfarin or other coumarin-derivative anticoagulants\n[see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7)].\n5.10 Embryo-fetal Toxicity\nBased on animal data and its mechanism of action, TARCEVA can cause fetal harm when administered\nto a pregnant woman. When given during organogenesis, erlotinib administration resulted in embryo-\nfetal lethality and abortion in rabbits at exposures approximately 3 times the exposure at the\nrecommended human daily dose of 150 mg. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy and for one\nmonth after the last dose of TARCEVA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and (8.3), Clinical\nPharmacology (12.1)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following serious adverse reactions, which may include fatalities, are discussed in greater detail in\nother sections of the labeling:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n6.1 Clinical Trial Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed\nin the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug\nand may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nSafety evaluation of TARCEVA is based on more than 1200 cancer patients who received TARCEVA\nas monotherapy, more than 300 patients who received TARCEVA 100 or 150 mg plus gemcitabine, and\n1228 patients who received TARCEVA concurrently with other chemotherapies. The most common\nadverse reactions with TARCEVA are rash and diarrhea usually with onset during the first month of\ntreatment. The incidences of rash and diarrhea from clinical studies of TARCEVA for the treatment of\nNSCLC and pancreatic cancer were 70% for rash and 42% for diarrhea.\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer\nFirst-Line Treatment of Patients with EGFR Mutations\nThe most frequent (\u2265 30%) adverse reactions in TARCEVA-treated patients were diarrhea, asthenia,\nrash, cough, dyspnea, and decreased appetite. In TARCEVA-treated patients the median time to onset of\nrash was 15 days and the median time to onset of diarrhea was 32 days.\nThe most frequent Grade 3-4 adverse reactions in TARCEVA-treated patients were rash and diarrhea.\nDose interruptions or reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 37% of TARCEVA-treated\npatients, and 14.3% of TARCEVA-treated patients discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. In\nTARCEVA-treated patients, the most frequently reported adverse reactions leading to dose\nmodification were rash (13%), diarrhea (10%), and asthenia (3.6%).\nCommon adverse reactions in Study 1, occurring in at least 10% of patients who received TARCEVA\nor chemotherapy and an increase in \u2265 5% in the TARCEVA-treated group, are graded by National\nCancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE v3.0) Grade\nin Table 1.

These adverse reactions were reported as peptic ulcer bleeding (gastritis, gastroduodenal ulcers),\nhematemesis, hematochezia, melena and hemorrhage from possible colitis.\n6.2 Post-Marketing Experience\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of TARCEVA.\nBecause these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always\npossible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, in combination\nwith statin therapy\nEye Disorders: ocular inflammation including uveitis\n7 DRUG INTERACTIONS\nCYP3A4 Inhibitors\nCo-administration of TARCEVA with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or a combined CYP3A4 and CYP1A2\ninhibitor increased erlotinib exposure. Erlotinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and to a lesser\nextent by CYP1A2. Increased erlotinib exposure may increase the risk of exposure-related toxicity [see\nClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nAvoid co-administering TARCEVA with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir, clarithromycin,\nconivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir,\nposaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole, grapefruit or grapefruit juice) or a\ncombined CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitor (e.g., ciprofloxacin). Reduce the TARCEVA dosage when\nco-administering with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or a combined CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitor if co-\nadministration is unavoidable [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\nCYP3A4 Inducers\nPre-treatment with a CYP3A4 inducer prior to TARCEVA decreased erlotinib exposure [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.3)]. Increase the TARCEVA dosage if co-administration with CYP3A4 inducers\n(e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital and St. John's wort) is\nunavoidable [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\nCYP1A2 Inducers and Cigarette Smoking\nCigarette smoking decreased erlotinib exposure. Avoid smoking tobacco (CYP1A2 inducer) and avoid\nconcomitant use of TARCEVA with moderate CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., teriflunomide, rifampin, or\nphenytoin). Increase the TARCEVA dosage in patients that smoke tobacco or when co-administration\nwith moderate CYP1A2 inducers is unavoidable [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical\n2\n2\nPharmacology (12.3)].\nDrugs the Increase Gastric pH\nCo-administration of TARCEVA with proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) and H-2 receptor\nantagonists (e.g., ranitidine) decreased erlotinib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. For proton\npump inhibitors, avoid concomitant use if possible. For H-2 receptor antagonists and antacids, modify\nthe dosing schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Increasing the dose of TARCEVA when co-\nadministered with gastric PH elevating agents is not likely to compensate for the loss of exposure.\nAnticoagulants\nInteraction with coumarin-derived anticoagulants, including warfarin, leading to increased International\nNormalized Ratio (INR) and bleeding adverse reactions, which in some cases were fatal, have been\nreported in patients receiving TARCEVA. Regularly monitor prothrombin time or INR in patients taking\ncoumarin-derived anticoagulants. Dose modifications of TARCEVA are not recommended [see\nWarnings and Precautions (5.9) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on animal data and its mechanism of action, TARCEVA can cause fetal harm when administered to\na pregnant woman. Limited available data on use of TARCEVA in pregnant women are not sufficient to\ninform a risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. When given during organogenesis, erlotinib\nadministration resulted in embryo-fetal lethality and abortion in rabbits at exposures approximately\n3 times the exposure at the recommended human daily dose of 150 mg. Advise pregnant women of the\npotential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in\nclinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nErlotinib has been shown to cause maternal toxicity resulting in embryo-fetal lethality and abortion in\nrabbits when given during the period of organogenesis at doses that result in plasma drug\nconcentrations approximately 3 times those achieved at the recommended dose in humans (AUCs at\n150 mg daily dose). During the same period, there was no increase in the incidence of embryo-fetal\nlethality or abortion in rabbits or rats at doses resulting in exposures approximately equal to those in\nhumans at the recommended daily dose. In an independent fertility study female rats treated with 30\nmg/m /day or 60 mg/m /day (0.3 or 0.7 times the recommended daily dose, on a mg/m basis) of\nerlotinib had an increase in early resorptions that resulted in a decrease in the number of live fetuses.\nNo teratogenic effects were observed in rabbits or rats dosed with erlotinib during organogenesis at\ndoses up to 600 mg/m /day in the rabbit (3 times the plasma drug concentration seen in humans at\n150 mg/day) and up to 60 mg/m /day in the rat (0.7 times the recommended dose of 150 mg/day on a\nmg/m basis).\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of erlotinib in human milk, or the effects of erlotinib on the breastfed\ninfant or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants\nfrom TARCEVA, including interstitial lung disease, hepatotoxicity, bullous and exfoliative skin\ndisorders, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia, ocular disorders, and diarrhea.\n2\n2\n2 \n2\n2\n2 \nAdvise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with TARCEVA and for 2 weeks after the\nfinal dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nContraception\nFemales\nTARCEVA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations\n(8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with\nTARCEVA and for one month after the last dose of TARCEVA.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of TARCEVA in pediatric patients have not been established.\nIn an open-label, multicenter trial, 25 pediatric patients (median age 14 years, range 3-20 years) with\nrecurrent or refractory ependymoma were randomized (1:1) to TARCEVA or etoposide. Thirteen\npatients received TARCEVA at a dose of 85 mg/m /day orally until disease progression, death, patient\nrequest, investigator decision to discontinue study drug, or intolerable toxicity. Four patients\nrandomized to etoposide also received TARCEVA following disease progression. The trial was\nterminated prematurely for lack of efficacy; there were no objective responses observed in these 17\nTARCEVA-treated patients.\nNo new adverse events were identified in the pediatric population.\nBased on the population pharmacokinetics analysis conducted in 105 pediatric patients (2 to 21 years\nold) with cancer, the geometric mean estimates of CL/F/BSA (apparent clearance normalized to body\nsurface area) were comparable across the three age groups: 2-6 years (n = 29), 7-16 years (n = 59), and\n17-21 years (n = 17).\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the 1297 subjects in clinical studies of TARCEVA for the treatment of NSCLC and pancreatic\ncancer 40% were 65 and older while 10% were 75 and older. No overall differences in safety or\nefficacy were observed between subjects 65 years and older and those younger than 65.\n8.6 Hepatic Impairment\nHepatic failure and hepatorenal syndrome, including fatal cases, can occur with TARCEVA treatment in\npatients with normal hepatic function; the risk of hepatic toxicity is increased in patients with baseline\nhepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2), and Dosage and\nAdministration]. Monitor patients with hepatic impairment (total bilirubin greater than upper limit of\nnormal (ULN) or Child-Pugh A, B and C) during therapy with TARCEVA. Treatment with TARCEVA\nshould be used with increased monitoring in patients with total bilirubin greater than 3 x ULN [see\nWarnings and Precautions (5.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2), and Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\n10 OVERDOSAGE\nWithhold TARCEVA in patients with an overdose or suspected overdose and institute symptomatic\ntreatment.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nTARCEVA (erlotinib), a kinase inhibitor, is a quinazolinamine with the chemical name N-(3-\nethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazolinamine. TARCEVA contains erlotinib as the\nhydrochloride salt that has the following structural formula:\n2\nErlotinib hydrochloride has the molecular formula C\nH\nN O .HCl and a molecular weight of\n429.90. The molecule has a pK  of 5.42 at 25\u00b0C. Erlotinib hydrochloride is very slightly soluble in\nwater, slightly soluble in methanol and practically insoluble in acetonitrile, acetone, ethyl acetate and\nhexane.\nAqueous solubility of erlotinib hydrochloride is dependent on pH with increased solubility at a pH of\nless than 5 due to protonation of the secondary amine. Over the pH range of 1.4 to 9.6, maximal\nsolubility of approximately 0.4 mg/mL occurs at a pH of approximately 2.\nTARCEVA tablets for oral administration are available in three dosage strengths containing erlotinib\nhydrochloride (27.3 mg, 109.3 mg and 163.9 mg) equivalent to 25 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg erlotinib and\nthe following inactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate, hypromellose, hydroxypropyl cellulose,\nmagnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, sodium lauryl sulfate and\ntitanium dioxide. The tablets also contain trace amounts of color additives, including FD&C Yellow #6\n(25 mg only) for product identification.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nEpidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is expressed on the cell surface of both normal and cancer\ncells. In some tumor cells signaling through this receptor plays a role in tumor cell survival and\nproliferation irrespective of EGFR mutation status. Erlotinib reversibly inhibits the kinase activity of\nEGFR, preventing autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues associated with the receptor and thereby\ninhibiting further downstream signaling. Erlotinib binding affinity for EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon\n21 (L858R) mutations is higher than its affinity for the wild type receptor. Erlotinib inhibition of other\ntyrosine kinase receptors has not been fully characterized.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nAbsorption\nErlotinib is about 60% absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma levels occur 4 hours after\ndosing.\nEffect of Food\nFood increased the bioavailability of erlotinib to approximately 100%.\nDistribution:\nErlotinib is 93% protein bound to plasma albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG).\nErlotinib has an apparent volume of distribution of 232 liters.\nElimination\nErlotinib is eliminated with a median half-life of 36.2 hours in patients receiving the single-agent\nTARCEVA 2\n/3  line regimen. Time to reach steady state plasma concentration would therefore be 7-\n22\n23\n3\n4\na\nnd\nrd\n8 days.\nMetabolism\nErlotinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2, and the extrahepatic\nisoform CYP1A1, in vitro.\nExcretion\nFollowing a 100 mg oral dose, 91% of the dose was recovered: 83% in feces (1% of the dose as intact\nparent) and 8% in urine (0.3% of the dose as intact parent).\nSpecific Populations\nNeither age, body weight, nor gender had a clinically significant effect on the systemic exposure of\nerlotinib in NSCLC patients receiving single-agent TARCEVA for 2\n/3  line treatment or for\nmaintenance treatment, and in pancreatic cancer patients who received erlotinib plus gemcitabine. The\npharmacokinetics of TARCEVA in patients with compromised renal function is unknown.\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\nIn vitro and in vivo evidence suggest that erlotinib is cleared primarily by the liver. However, erlotinib\nexposure was similar in patients with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh B) compared\nwith patients with adequate hepatic function including patients with primary liver cancer or hepatic\nmetastases.\nPatients That Smoke Tobacco Cigarettes\nIn a single-dose pharmacokinetics trial in healthy volunteers, cigarette smoking (moderate CYP1A2\ninducer) increased erlotinib clearance and decreased erlotinib AUC\nby 64% (95% CI, 46-76%) in\ncurrent smokers compared with former/never smokers. In a NSCLC trial, current smokers achieved\nerlotinib steady-state trough plasma concentrations which were approximately 2-fold less than the\nformer smokers or patients who had never smoked. This effect was accompanied by a 24% increase in\napparent erlotinib plasma clearance. In another study which was conducted in NSCLC patients who were\ncurrent smokers, pharmacokinetic analyses at steady-state indicated a dose-proportional increase in\nerlotinib exposure when the TARCEVA dose was increased from 150 mg to 300 mg. [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.4), Drug Interactions (7) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].\nDrug Interaction Studies\nCo-administration of gemcitabine had no effect on erlotinib plasma clearance.\nCYP3A4 Inhibitors\nCo-administration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, increased erlotinib AUC by 67%. Co-\nadministration with a combined CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitor, ciprofloxacin, increased erlotinib\nexposure [AUC] by 39%, and increased erlotinib maximum concentration [C\n] by 17%. [see Dose\nModifications (2.4), Drug Interactions (7)].\nCYP3A4 Inducers\nPre-treatment with the CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin, for 7-11 days prior to TARCEVA, decreased\nerlotinib AUC by 58% to 80% [see Dose Modifications (2.4), Drug Interactions (7)].\nCYP1A2 Inducers or Smoking Tobacco\nSee Specific Populations Section [see Dose Modifications (2.4), Drug Interactions (7)].\nDrugs that Increase Gastric pH\nErlotinib solubility is pH dependent and decreases as pH increases. When a proton pump inhibitor\n(omeprazole) was co-administered with TARCEVA the erlotinib exposure [AUC] was decreased by\n46% and the erlotinib maximum concentration [C\n] was decreased by 61%. When TARCEVA was\nadministered 2 hours following a 300 mg dose of an H-2 receptor antagonist (ranitidine), the erlotinib\nnd\nrd\n0-inf \nmax\nmax\nAUC was reduced by 33% and the erlotinib C\n was reduced by 54%. When TARCEVA was\nadministered with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily (at least 10 h after the previous ranitidine evening dose\nand 2 h before the ranitidine morning dose), the erlotinib AUC was decreased by 15% and the erlotinib\nC\n was decreased by 17% [see Dose Modifications (2.4), Drug Interactions (7)].\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nTwo-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats with erlotinib at oral doses of up to\n60 mg/kg/day in mice, 5 mg/kg/day in female rats, and 10 mg/kg/day in male rats. The studies were\nnegative for carcinogenic findings. Exposure in mice at the highest dose tested was approximately 10\ntimes the exposure in humans at the erlotinib dose of 150 mg/day. The highest dose evaluated in male\nrats resulted in exposures that were twice those in humans and exposures at the highest tested dose in\nfemale rats were slightly lower than those in humans.\nErlotinib did not cause genetic damage in a series of in vitro assays (bacterial mutation, human\nlymphocyte chromosome aberration and mammalian cell mutation) and in the in vivo mouse bone marrow\nmicronucleus test.\nErlotinib did not impair fertility in either male or female rats.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) \u2013 First-Line Treatment of Patients with EGFR\nMutations\nStudy 1\nThe safety and efficacy of TARCEVA as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with\nmetastatic NSCLC containing EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations was\ndemonstrated in Study 1, a randomized, open-label, clinical trial conducted in Europe. One hundred\nseventy-four (174) White patients were randomized 1:1 to receive erlotinib 150 mg once daily until\ndisease progression (n = 86) or four cycles of a standard platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (n =\n88); standard chemotherapy regimens were cisplatin plus gemcitabine, cisplatin plus docetaxel,\ncarboplatin plus gemcitabine, and carboplatin plus docetaxel. The main efficacy outcome measure was\nprogression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the investigator. Randomization was stratified by EGFR\nmutation (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 (L858R) substitution) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group\nPerformance Status (ECOG PS) (0 vs. 1 vs. 2). EGFR mutation status for screening and enrollment of\npatients was determined by a clinical trials assay (CTA). Tumor samples from 134 patients (69 patients\nfrom the erlotinib arm and 65 patients from the chemotherapy arm) were tested retrospectively by the\nFDA-approved companion diagnostic, cobas  EGFR Mutation Test.\nBaseline demographics of the overall study population were: female (72%), White (99%), age \u2265 65\nyears (51%), ECOG PS 1 (53%), with ECOG PS 0 (33%), and ECOG PS 2 (14%), current smoker (11%),\npast-smoker (20%), and never smoker (69%). The disease characteristics were 93% Stage IV and 7%\nStage IIIb with pleural effusion as classified by the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC, 6\nedition), 93% adenocarcinoma, 66% exon 19 mutation deletions and 34% exon 21 (L858R) point\nmutation by CTA.\nA statistically significant improvement in investigator-determined PFS (based on RECIST 1.0 or clinical\nprogression) was demonstrated for patients randomized to erlotinib compared to those randomized to\nchemotherapy (see Table 6 and Figure 1). Similar results for PFS (based on RECIST 1.0) were\nobserved for the subgroup evaluated by an independent-review committee (approximately 75% of\npatients evaluated in Study 1) and in the subgroup of 134 patients (77% of Study 1 population) with\nEGFR mutations confirmed by the cobas  EGFR Mutation Test.\nmax\nmax\n\u00ae\nth\n\u00ae\nA protocol-specified analysis of overall survival (OS) conducted at the time of the final analysis of PFS\nshowed no statistically significant difference between the TARCEVA and chemotherapy arms.

Study 2 was a multicenter, placebo-controlled,\nrandomized trial of 643 patients with advanced NSCLC without an EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21\nL858R mutation who had not experienced disease progression after four cycles of platinum-based\nchemotherapy. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive TARCEVA 150 mg or placebo orally once\ndaily (322 TARCEVA, 321 placebo) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Following\nprogression on initial therapy, patients were eligible to enter an open-label phase. Baseline\ncharacteristics were as follows: median age 61 years (35% age \u2265 65 years), 75% male, 77% White,\n21% Asian, 28% ECOG PS 0, 72% ECOG PS 1, 16% never smokers, 58% current smokers, 57%\nadenocarcinoma, 35% squamous cell carcinoma, 22% stage IIIB disease not amenable to combined\nmodality treatment, and 78% stage IV disease. Fifty percent of patients randomized to TARCEVA\nentered the open-label phase and received chemotherapy, while 77% of patients randomized to placebo\nentered the open-label phase and received TARCEVA.\nThe main efficacy outcome was overall survival (OS). Median OS was 9.7 months in the TARCEVA\narm and 9.5 months in the placebo arm; the hazard ratio for OS was 1.02 (95% CI 0.85, 1.22). Median\nPFS was 3.0 months in the TARCEVA arm and 2.8 months in the placebo arm; the hazard ratio for PFS\nwas 0.94 (95% CI 0.80, 1.11).\n14.3 NSCLC \u2013 Maintenance Treatment or Second/Third Line Treatment\nTwo randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, Studies 3 and 4, examined the efficacy and\nsafety of TARCEVA administered to patients with metastatic NSCLC as maintenance therapy after initial\ntreatment with chemotherapy (Study 3) or with disease progression following initial treatment with\nchemotherapy (Study 4). Determination of EGFR mutation status was not required for enrollment.\nStudy 3\nThe efficacy and safety of TARCEVA as maintenance treatment of NSCLC were demonstrated in Study\n3, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 26 countries, in 889 patients with\nmetastatic NSCLC whose disease did not progress during first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.\nPatients were randomized 1:1 to receive TARCEVA 150 mg or placebo orally once daily (438\nTARCEVA, 451 placebo) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective of\nthe study was to determine if the administration of TARCEVA after standard platinum-based\nchemotherapy in the treatment of NSCLC resulted in improved progression-free survival (PFS) when\ncompared with placebo, in all patients or in patients with EGFR immunohistochemistry (IHC) positive\ntumors.\nBaseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (74%), age < 65 years\n(66%), ECOG PS 1 (69%), ECOG PS 0 (31%), white (84%), Asian (15%), current smoker (55%), past-\nsmoker (27%), and never smoker (17%). Disease characteristics were as follows: Stage IV (75%), Stage\nIIIb with effusion (25%) as classified by AJCC (6  edition) with histologic subtypes of\nadenocarcinoma including bronchioalveolar (45%), squamous (40%) and large cell (5%); and EGFR\nIHC positive (70%), negative (14%), indeterminate (4%), and missing (12%).\nTable 7: Efficacy Results (Study 3): (ITT Population)\nEfficacy Parameter\nTARCEVA\n(N = 438)\nPlacebo\n(N = 451)\nProgression-Free Survival (PFS) based on investigator assessment\n      Number of Progression or Deaths\n(%)\n349 (80%)\n400 (89%)\n      Median PFS in Months (95% CI)\n2.8 (2.8, 3.1)\n2.6 (1.9, 2.7)\n      Hazard Ratio (95% CI) \n0.71 (0.62, 0.82)\nth\n*\n\u2020\n\u2020\u2021\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n      p-value (stratified log-rank test) \np < 0.0001\nOverall Survival (OS)\n      Number of Deaths\n298 (68%)\n350 (78%)\n      Median OS in Months (95% CI)\n12.0 (10.6, 13.9)\n11.0 (9.9, 12.1)\n      Hazard Ratio (95% CI) \n0.81 (0.70, 0.95)\n      p-value (stratified log-rank test) \n0.0088\nFigure 2 depicts the Kaplan-Meier Curves for Overall Survival (ITT Population).\nFigure 2: Kaplan-Meier Curves for Overall Survival of Patients by Treatment Group in Study 3\nNote: HR is from a univariate Cox regression model.\nStudy 4\nThe efficacy and safety of single-agent TARCEVA was assessed in Study 4, a randomized, double\nblind, placebo-controlled trial in 731 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure\nof at least one chemotherapy regimen. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive TARCEVA 150 mg or\nplacebo (488 TARCEVA, 243 placebo) orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable\ntoxicity. Efficacy outcome measures included overall survival, response rate, and progression-free\nsurvival (PFS). Duration of response was also examined. The primary endpoint was survival. The study\nwas conducted in 17 countries.\nBaseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (65%), White (78%),\nAsian (12%), Black (4%), age < 65 years (62%), ECOG PS 1 (53%), ECOG PS 0 (13%), ECOG PS 2\n(25%), ECOG PS 3 (9%), current or ex-smoker (75%), never smoker (20%), and exposure to prior\nplatinum therapy (93%).

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive\nTARCEVA (100 mg or 150 mg) or placebo once daily on a continuous schedule plus gemcitabine by\nintravenous infusion (1000 mg/m , Cycle 1 - Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 and 43 of an 8-week cycle; Cycle\n2 and subsequent cycles - Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 4-week cycle [the approved dose and schedule for\npancreatic cancer, see the gemcitabine package insert]). TARCEVA or placebo was taken orally once\ndaily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was survival. Secondary\nendpoints included response rate, and progression-free survival (PFS). Duration of response was also\nexamined. The study was conducted in 18 countries. A total of 285 patients were randomized to receive\ngemcitabine plus TARCEVA (261 patients in the 100 mg cohort and 24 patients in the 150 mg cohort)\nand 284 patients were randomized to receive gemcitabine plus placebo (260 patients in the 100 mg\ncohort and 24 patients in the 150 mg cohort). Too few patients were treated in the 150 mg cohort to\ndraw conclusions.\nIn the 100 mg cohort, baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male\n(52%), white (88%), Asian (7%), black (2%), age < 65 years (53%), ECOG PS 1 (51%), ECOG PS 0\n(32%), and ECOG PS 2 (17%). There was a slightly larger proportion of females in the TARCEVA arm\n(51%) compared with the placebo arm (44%). The median time from initial diagnosis to randomization\nwas approximately 1.0 month. The majority of the patients (76%) had distant metastases at baseline and\n24% had locally advanced disease.\nThe results of the study are shown in Table 9.\nTable 9: Efficacy Results: TARCEVA 100 mg Cohort (Study 5)\n*\n\u2020\nEfficacy Parameter\nTARCEVA +\nGemcitabine\n(N = 261)\nPlacebo + Gemcitabine\n(N = 260)\nOverall Survival (OS)\n     Number of Deaths\n250\n254\n     Median OS in Months (95% CI)\n6.5 (6.0, 7.4)\n6.0 (5.1, 6.7)\n     Hazard Ratio (95% CI) \n0.81 (0.68, 0.97)\n     p-value (stratified log-rank test) \n0.028\nProgression-Free Survival (PFS)\n     Number of Progression or Deaths (%)\n225\n232\n     Median PFS in Months (95% CI)\n3.8 (3.6, 4.9)\n3.6 (3.3, 3.8)\n     Hazard Ratio (95% CI)\n0.76 (0.64, 0.92)\nObjective Response\n     Objective Response Rate (95% CI)\n8.6% (5.4, 12.9)\n7.9% (4.8, 12.0)\nSurvival was evaluated in the intent-to-treat population.

Tablets may be\ndispersed in water for patients who have difficulty swallowing, or for nasogastric tube\nadministration [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\nMissed Dose\nIf a dose of TAGRISSO is missed, do not make up the missed dose and take the next\ndose as scheduled.\n2.4 Administration to Patients Who Have Difficulty Swallowing Solids\nDisperse tablet in 60 mL (2 ounces) of non-carbonated water only. Stir until tablet is\ndispersed into small pieces (the tablet will not completely dissolve) and swallow\nimmediately. Do not crush, heat, or ultrasonicate during preparation. Rinse the container\nwith 120 mL to 240 mL (4 to 8 ounces) of water and immediately drink.\nIf administration via nasogastric tube is required, disperse the tablet as above in 15 mL\nof non-carbonated water, and then use an additional 15 mL of water to transfer any\nresidues to the syringe. The resulting 30 mL liquid should be administered as per the\nnasogastric tube instructions with appropriate water flushes (approximately 30 mL).\nRepeat this step until no pieces remain in the syringe. This will help to ensure that the full\nprescribed dose of the TAGRISSO is given. The dispersion and residues should be\nadministered within 30 minutes of the addition of the tablets to water.\n2.5 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions\nThe recommended dose reductions for adverse reactions are provided in Table 2.\nTable 2.

Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO if ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed\n[see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n5.2 QTc Interval Prolongation\nHeart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation occurs in patients treated with\nTAGRISSO. Of the 1813 patients treated with TAGRISSO monotherapy in clinical trials,\n1.1% were found to have a QTc >500 msec, and 4.3% of patients had an increase from\nbaseline QTc >60 msec [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].\nOf the 276 patients treated with TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and\nplatinum-based chemotherapy in the FLAURA2 study, 1.8% were found to have a QTc\n>500 msec, and 10.5% of patients had an increase from baseline QTc >60 msec.\nNo QTc-related arrhythmias were reported.\nClinical trials of TAGRISSO did not enroll patients with baseline QTc of >470 msec.\nConduct periodic monitoring with ECGs and electrolytes in patients with congenital long\nQTc syndrome, congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or those who are\ntaking medications known to prolong the QTc interval. Permanently discontinue\nTAGRISSO in patients who develop QTc interval prolongation with signs/symptoms of\nlife-threatening arrhythmia [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\n5.3 Cardiomyopathy\nAcross clinical trials, cardiomyopathy (defined as cardiac failure, chronic cardiac failure,\ncongestive heart failure, pulmonary edema or decreased ejection fraction) occurred in\n3.8% of the 1813 TAGRISSO-treated patients; 0.1% of cardiomyopathy cases were fatal.\nIn the FLAURA2 study, cardiomyopathy occurred in 9% of the 276 patients who\nreceived TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy;\n1.1% of cardiomyopathy cases were fatal.\nA decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u226510 percentage points from baseline\nand to less than 50% LVEF occurred in 4.2% of 1557 patients who had baseline and at\nleast one follow-up LVEF assessment. In the ADAURA study, 1.5% (5/325) of patients\ntreated with TAGRISSO experienced LVEF decreases greater than or equal to 10\npercentage points and a drop to less than 50%. In the FLAURA2 study, 8% (21/262) of\npatients treated with TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based\nchemotherapy, who had baseline and at least one follow-up LVEF assessment,\nexperienced LVEF decreases greater than or equal to 10 percentage points and a drop\nto less than 50%.\nFor patients who will be receiving TAGRISSO monotherapy, conduct cardiac monitoring,\nincluding assessment of LVEF at baseline and during treatment, in patients with cardiac\nrisk factors.\nFor patients who will be receiving TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and\nplatinum-based chemotherapy, conduct cardiac monitoring, including assessment of\nLVEF at baseline and during treatment, in all patients.\nAssess LVEF in patients who develop relevant cardiac signs or symptoms during\ntreatment. For symptomatic congestive heart failure, permanently discontinue\nTAGRISSO [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\n5.4 Keratitis\nKeratitis was reported in 0.6% of 1813 patients treated with TAGRISSO monotherapy in\nclinical trials. Promptly refer patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis\n(such as eye inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain and/or\nred eye) to an ophthalmologist.\n5.5 Erythema Multiforme Major, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and Toxic\nEpidermal Necrolysis\nPostmarketing cases consistent with erythema multiforme major (EMM), Stevens-\nJohnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in\npatients receiving TAGRISSO [see Postmarketing (6.2)]. Withhold TAGRISSO if EMM, SJS,\nor TEN is suspected and permanently discontinue if confirmed.\n5.6 Cutaneous Vasculitis\nPostmarketing cases of cutaneous vasculitis including leukocytoclastic vasculitis,\nurticarial vasculitis, and IgA vasculitis have been reported in patients receiving TAGRISSO\n[see Postmarketing (6.2)]. Withhold TAGRISSO if cutaneous vasculitis is suspected,\nevaluate for systemic involvement, and consider dermatology consultation. If no other\netiology can be identified, consider permanent discontinuation of TAGRISSO based on\nseverity.\n5.7 Aplastic Anemia\nAplastic anemia has been reported in patients treated with TAGRISSO in clinical trials\n(0.06% of 1813) and postmarketing [see Postmarketing (6.2)]. Some cases had a fatal\noutcome. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of aplastic anemia including but\nnot limited to, new or persistent fevers, bruising, bleeding, and pallor. If aplastic anemia\nis suspected, withhold TAGRISSO and obtain a hematology consultation. If aplastic\nanemia is confirmed, permanently discontinue TAGRISSO [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.5)].\nPerform complete blood count with differential before starting TAGRISSO, periodically\nthroughout treatment, and more frequently if indicated.\n5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action, TAGRISSO can cause\nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies,\nosimertinib caused post-implantation fetal loss when administered during early\ndevelopment at a dose exposure 1.5 times the exposure at the recommended clinical\ndose. When males were treated prior to mating with untreated females, there was an\nincrease in preimplantation embryonic loss at plasma exposures of approximately 0.5\ntimes those observed at the recommended dose of 80 mg once daily. Verify pregnancy\nstatus of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TAGRISSO. Advise pregnant\nwomen of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use\neffective contraception during treatment with TAGRISSO and for 6 weeks after the final\ndose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective\ncontraception for 4 months after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1and\n8.3)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the\nlabeling:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe data in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section reflect exposure to TAGRISSO in\n1813 patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC who received TAGRISSO\nmonotherapy at the recommended dose of 80 mg once daily in four randomized,\ncontrolled trials [ADAURA (n=337), FLAURA (n=338), FLAURA2 (monotherapy arm;\nn=275), and AURA3 (n=279)], two single arm trials [AURA Extension (n=201) and\nAURA2 (n=210)], and one dose-finding study, AURA1 (n=173) [see WARNINGS AND\nPRECAUTIONS (5)]. Among 1813 patients who received TAGRISSO monotherapy, 82%\nwere exposed for 6 months or longer and 67% were exposed for greater than one year.\nIn this pooled safety population, the most common adverse reactions in \u226520% of 1813\npatients who received TAGRISSO monotherapy were diarrhea (47%), rash (46%),\nmusculoskeletal pain (38%), nail toxicity (34%), dry skin (32%), stomatitis (24%), and\nfatigue (21%). The most common laboratory abnormalities in \u226520% of 1813 patients\nwho received TAGRISSO monotherapy were leukopenia (65%), lymphopenia (64%),\nthrombocytopenia (53%), anemia (52%), and neutropenia (36%).\nThe data described below reflect exposure to TAGRISSO (80 mg daily) in 337 patients\nwith EGFR mutation-positive resectable NSCLC, and 833 patients with EGFR mutation-\npositive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in four randomized, controlled trials\n[ADAURA (n=337), FLAURA (n=279), FLAURA2 (monotherapy arm; n=275), and AURA3\nInterstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nQTc Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nCardiomyopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\nKeratitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]\nErythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and Toxic epidermal necrolysis\n[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]\nCutaneous Vasculitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]\nAplastic Anemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]\n(n=279)]. The data also reflect exposure to TAGRISSO at the recommended dose of 80\nmg daily given in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy in\n276 patients with EGFR mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in one\nrandomized controlled trial [FLAURA2 (n=276)]. Patients with a history of interstitial lung\ndisease, drug induced interstitial disease or radiation pneumonitis that required steroid\ntreatment, serious arrhythmia or baseline QTc interval greater than 470 msec on\nelectrocardiogram were excluded from enrollment in these studies.\nAdjuvant Treatment of EGFR Mutation-Positive NSCLC - Monotherapy\nThe safety of TAGRISSO was evaluated in ADAURA, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled trial for the adjuvant treatment of patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions or\nexon 21 L858R mutation-positive NSCLC who had complete tumor resection, with or\nwithout prior adjuvant chemotherapy. At time of DFS analysis, the median duration of\nexposure to TAGRISSO was 22.5 months.\nSerious adverse reactions were reported in 16% of patients treated with TAGRISSO. The\nmost common serious adverse reaction (\u22651%) was pneumonia (1.5%). Adverse\nreactions leading to dose reductions occurred in 9% of patients treated with TAGRISSO.\nThe most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose reductions or interruptions were\ndiarrhea (4.5%), stomatitis (3.9%), nail toxicity (1.8%) and rash (1.8%). Adverse\nreactions leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 11% of patients treated with\nTAGRISSO. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of TAGRISSO\nwere interstitial lung disease (2.7%), and rash (1.2%).\nTables 3 and 4 summarize common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities\nwhich occurred in ADAURA.\nTable 3.

A total of 279 patients received TAGRISSO 80 mg orally\nonce daily until intolerance to therapy, disease progression, or investigator\ndetermination that the patient was no longer benefiting from treatment. A total of 136\npatients received pemetrexed plus either carboplatin or cisplatin every three weeks for\nup to 6 cycles; patients without disease progression after 4 cycles of chemotherapy\ncould continue maintenance pemetrexed until disease progression, unacceptable\ntoxicity, or investigator determination that the patient was no longer benefiting from\ntreatment. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) was evaluated at screening and\nevery 12 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 8.1 months for patients treated\nwith TAGRISSO and 4.2 months for chemotherapy-treated patients. The trial population\ncharacteristics were: median age 62 years, age less than 65 (58%), female (64%), Asian\n(65%), never smokers (68%), and ECOG PS 0 or 1 (100%).\nSerious adverse reactions were reported in 18% of patients treated with TAGRISSO and\n26% in the chemotherapy group. No single serious adverse reaction was reported in 2%\nor more patients treated with TAGRISSO.

Decreased osimertinib exposure may lead to reduced efficacy.\nAvoid co-administering TAGRISSO with strong CYP3A inducers. Increase the TAGRISSO\ndosage when co-administering with a strong CYP3A4 inducer if concurrent use is\nunavoidable [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. No dose adjustments are required\nwhen TAGRISSO is used with moderate and/or weak CYP3A inducers.\n7.2 Effect of Osimertinib on Other Drugs\nCo-administering TAGRISSO with a breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) or P-\nglycoprotein (P-gp) substrate increased the exposure of the substrate compared to\nadministering it alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Increased BCRP or P-gp\nsubstrate exposure may increase the risk of exposure-related toxicity.\nMonitor for adverse reactions of the BCRP or P-gp substrate, unless otherwise\ninstructed in its approved labeling, when co-administered with TAGRISSO.\n7.3 Drugs That Prolong the QTc Interval\nThe effect of co-administering medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval\nwith TAGRISSO is unknown. When feasible, avoid concomitant administration of drugs\nknown to prolong the QTc interval with known risk of Torsades de pointes. If not feasible\nto avoid concomitant administration of such drugs, conduct periodic ECG monitoring\n[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.1)], TAGRISSO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant\nwoman. There are no available data on TAGRISSO use in pregnant women.\nAdministration of osimertinib to pregnant rats was associated with embryolethality and\nreduced fetal growth at plasma exposures 1.5 times the exposure at the recommended\nclinical dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nWhen administered to pregnant rats prior to embryonic implantation through the end of\norganogenesis (gestation days 2-20) at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day, which produced\nplasma exposures of approximately 1.5 times the clinical exposure, osimertinib caused\npost-implantation loss and early embryonic death. When administered to pregnant rats\nfrom implantation through the closure of the hard palate (gestation days 6 to 16) at\ndoses of 1 mg/kg/day and above (0.1 times the AUC observed at the recommended\nclinical dose of 80 mg once daily), an equivocal increase in the rate of fetal\nmalformations and variations was observed in treated litters relative to those of\nconcurrent controls. When administered to pregnant dams at doses of 30 mg/kg/day\nduring organogenesis through lactation Day 6, osimertinib caused an increase in total\nlitter loss and postnatal death. At a dose of 20 mg/kg/day, osimertinib administration\nduring the same period resulted in increased postnatal death as well as a slight reduction\nin mean pup weight at birth that increased in magnitude between lactation days 4 and 6.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of osimertinib or its active metabolites in human milk,\nthe effects of osimertinib on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Administration\nto rats during gestation and early lactation was associated with adverse effects,\nincluding reduced growth rates and neonatal death [see Use in Specific Populations\n(8.1)]. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from\nosimertinib, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with TAGRISSO and for 2\nweeks after the final dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nBased on animal data, TAGRISSO can cause malformations, embryo lethality, and\npostnatal death at doses resulting in exposures 1.5 times or less the human exposure\nat the clinical dose of 80 mg daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating\nTAGRISSO.\nContraception\nFemales\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment\nwith TAGRISSO and for 6 weeks after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations\n(8.1)].\nMales\nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective\ncontraception during and for 4 months following the final dose of TAGRISSO [see\nNonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\nInfertility\nBased on animal studies, TAGRISSO may impair fertility in females and males of\nreproductive potential. The effects on female fertility showed a trend toward reversibility.\nIt is not known whether the effects on male fertility are reversible [see Nonclinical\nIt is not known whether the effects on male fertility are reversible [see Nonclinical\nToxicology (13.1)].\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of TAGRISSO in pediatric patients have not been\nestablished.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nMonotherapy\nOf the 1813 patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation-positive\nNSCLC who were treated with TAGRISSO monotherapy, 770 patients were \u226565 years\nand 207 patients were \u226575 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Exploratory\nanalysis suggests a higher incidence of Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions (43% vs\n33%) and more frequent dosage modifications for adverse reactions (34% vs 23%) in\npatients 65 years or older as compared to those younger than 65 years. No overall\ndifferences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years or older\nand younger patients.\nTAGRISSO in Combination with Pemetrexed and Platinum-based Chemotherapy\nOf the 276 patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation-positive,\nlocally advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with TAGRISSO in combination with\npemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy, 104 patients were \u226565 years and 23\npatients were \u226575 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Exploratory analysis\nsuggests a higher incidence of Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions (68% vs 61%) and\nmore frequent dosage modifications for adverse reactions (55% vs 43%) in patients 65\nyears or older as compared to those younger than 65 years. Clinical studies of\nTAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy did not\ninclude sufficient numbers of patients age 65 and over to determine whether they\nrespond differently from younger patients.\n8.6 Renal Impairment\nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) 15 -\n89 mL/min, as estimated by Cockcroft-Gault. There is no recommended dose of\nTAGRISSO for patients with end-stage renal disease (CLcr <15 mL/min) [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.3)].\n8.7 Hepatic Impairment\nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild to moderate hepatic\nimpairment (Child-Pugh A and B or total bilirubin \u2264 ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin\n1 to 3 times ULN and any AST). There is no recommended dose for TAGRISSO for\npatients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin between 3 to 10 times ULN and\nany AST) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n11 DESCRIPTION\nOsimertinib is a kinase inhibitor for oral use. The molecular formula for osimertinib\nmesylate is C\nH\nN O \u2022CH O S, and the molecular weight is 596 g/mol. The chemical\nname is N-(2-{2-dimethylaminoethyl-methylamino}-4-methoxy-5-{[4-(1-methylindol-3-\n28\n33\n7\n2\n4\n3\nyl)pyrimidin-2-yl]amino}phenyl)prop-2-enamide mesylate salt. Osimertinib has the\nfollowing structural formula (as osimertinib mesylate):\nTAGRISSO tablets contain 40 or 80 mg of osimertinib, equivalent to 47.7 and 95.4 mg of\nosimertinib mesylate, respectively. Inactive ingredients in the tablet core are mannitol,\nmicrocrystalline cellulose, low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose and sodium stearyl\nfumarate. The tablet coating consists of polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, macrogol\n3350, talc, ferric oxide yellow, ferric oxide red and ferric oxide black.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nOsimertinib is a kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which\nbinds irreversibly to certain mutant forms of EGFR (T790M, L858R, and exon 19\ndeletions) at approximately 9-fold lower concentrations than wild-type. Two\npharmacologically-active metabolites (AZ7550 and AZ5104 circulating at approximately\n10% of the parent) with similar inhibitory profiles to osimertinib have been identified in\nthe plasma after oral administration of osimertinib. AZ7550 showed a similar potency to\nosimertinib, while AZ5104 showed greater potency against exon 19 deletion and T790M\nmutants (approximately 8-fold) and wild-type (approximately 15-fold) EGFR. In vitro,\nosimertinib also inhibited the activity of HER2, HER3, HER4, ACK1, and BLK at clinically\nrelevant concentrations.\nIn cultured cells and animal tumor implantation models, osimertinib exhibited anti-tumor\nactivity against NSCLC lines harboring EGFR-mutations (T790M/L858R, L858R,\nT790M/exon 19 deletion, and exon 19 deletion) and, to a lesser extent, wild-type EGFR\namplifications. Osimertinib distributed to the brain in multiple animal species (monkey,\nrat, and mouse) with brain to plasma AUC ratios of approximately 2 following oral\ndosing. These data are consistent with observations of tumor regression and increased\nsurvival in osimertinib- versus control-treated animals in a pre-clinical mutant-EGFR\nintracranial mouse metastasis xenograft model (PC9; exon 19 deletion).\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nBased on an analysis of dose-exposure response relationships over the dose range of\n20 mg (0.25 times the recommended dose) to 240 mg (3 times the recommended\ndose), no apparent relationship between osimertinib exposure and overall response rate,\nduration of response and progression-free survival was identified; however, there were\nlimited data available at the 20 mg dose. Over the same dose range, increased exposure\nled to increased probability of adverse reactions, specifically rash, diarrhea and ILD.\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nThe QTc interval prolongation potential of osimertinib was assessed in 210 patients who\nreceived TAGRISSO 80 mg daily in AURA2. A central tendency analysis of the QTcF data\nat steady-state demonstrated that the maximum mean change from baseline was 16.2\nmsec (upper bound of two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) 17.6 msec). A\npharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis in AURA2 suggested a concentration-\ndependent QTc interval prolongation of 14 msec (upper bound of two-sided 90% CI:\n16 msec) at a dose of TAGRISSO 80 mg.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximal plasma\nconcentration (C\n) of osimertinib increased dose proportionally over 20 to 240 mg\ndose range (i.e., 0.25 to 3 times the recommended dosage) after oral administration and\nexhibited linear pharmacokinetics (PK). Administration of TAGRISSO orally once daily\nresulted in approximately 3-fold accumulation with steady-state exposures achieved\nafter 15 days of dosing. At steady state, the C\nto C\n (minimal concentration) ratio\nwas 1.6-fold.\nThe pharmacokinetics in patients treated with osimertinib in combination with\npemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy are similar to those in patients treated\nwith osimertinib monotherapy.\nAbsorption\nThe median time to C\n of osimertinib was 6 hours (range 3-24 hours).\nFollowing administration of a 20 mg TAGRISSO tablet with a high-fat, high-calorie meal\n(containing approximately 58 grams of fat and 1000 calories), the C\n and AUC of\nosimertinib were comparable to that under fasting conditions.\nDistribution\nThe mean volume of distribution at steady-state (V\n/F) of osimertinib was 918 L. Plasma\nprotein binding of osimertinib was 95%. PET brain imaging studies in healthy volunteers\nand in patients with brain metastases show that osimertinib is distributed to the brain\nfollowing intravenous injection of a micro dose of \nC-labeled osimertinib.\nElimination\nOsimertinib plasma concentrations decreased with time and a population estimated\nmean half-life of osimertinib was 48 hours, and oral clearance (CL/F) was 14.3 (L/h).\nMetabolism\nThe main metabolic pathways of osimertinib were oxidation (predominantly CYP3A) and\ndealkylation in vitro. Two pharmacologically active metabolites (AZ7550 and AZ5104)\nhave been identified in the plasma after TAGRISSO oral administration. The geometric\nmean exposure (AUC) of each metabolite (AZ5104 and AZ7550) was approximately\n10% of the exposure of osimertinib at steady-state.\nExcretion\nOsimertinib is primarily eliminated in the feces (68%) and to a lesser extent in the urine\nmax\nmax \nmin\nmax\nmax\nss\n11\n(14%). Unchanged osimertinib accounted for approximately 2% of the elimination.\nSpecific Populations\nNo clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of osimertinib were observed\nbased on age, sex, ethnicity, body weight, baseline albumin, line of therapy, smoking\nstatus, renal function (creatinine clearance (CLcr) \u226515 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault), or\nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and B, or total bilirubin \u2264 ULN and AST > ULN or total\nbilirubin between 1 to 3 times ULN and any AST). The pharmacokinetics of osimertinib in\npatients with end-stage renal disease (CLcr <15 mL/min) or severe hepatic impairment\n(total bilirubin 3 to 10 times ULN and any AST) are unknown [see Use in Specific\nPopulations (8.6) and (8.7)].\nDrug Interaction Studies\nEffect of Other Drugs on TAGRISSO in Clinical Pharmacokinetic Studies Strong CYP3A\nInducers: The steady-state AUC of osimertinib was reduced by 78% in patients when co-\nadministered with rifampin (600 mg daily for 21 days) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].\nStrong CYP3A Inhibitors: Co-administering TAGRISSO with 200 mg itraconazole twice\ndaily (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) had no clinically significant effect on the exposure of\nosimertinib (AUC increased by 24% and C\n decreased by 20%).\nGastric Acid Reducing Agents: The exposure of osimertinib was not affected by\nconcurrent administration of a single 80 mg TAGRISSO tablet following 40 mg\nomeprazole administration for 5 days.\nEffect of Osimertinib on Other Drugs in Clinical Pharmacokinetic Studies\nBCRP substrates: Co-administering TAGRISSO with rosuvastatin (a BCRP substrate)\nincreased rosuvastatin AUC by 35% and C\n by 72% [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].\nP-gp substrates: Co-administering TAGRISSO with fexofenadine (a P-gp substrate)\nincreased fexofenadine AUC and C\n by 56% and 76% after a single dose and 27%\nand 25% at steady state, respectively.\nCYP3A4 substrates: Co-administering TAGRISSO with simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate)\nhad no clinically significant effect on the exposure of simvastatin.\nIn Vitro Studies\nCYP450 Metabolic Pathways: Osimertinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9,\n2C19, 2D6 and 2E1. Osimertinib induced CYP1A2 enzymes.\nTransporter Systems: Osimertinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and BCRP and is not a\nsubstrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Osimertinib is an inhibitor of BCRP and does not\ninhibit OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2K and OCT2.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nA 2-year carcinogenicity was conducted in male and female rats at oral osimertinib\ndoses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day. Osimertinib increased the incidences of hemangioma\nand combined hemangioma/hemangiosarcoma in the mesenteric lymph node and whole\nbody at 10 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the human exposure based on AUC at the clinical dose\nmax\nmax\nmax\nof 80 mg once daily). Administration of osimertinib to male and female rasH2 transgenic\nmice by oral gavage daily for 26 weeks did not result in an increased incidence of\nneoplasms at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day.\nOsimertinib did not induce mutations in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and\nwas not genotoxic in mouse lymphoma cells or in the rat in vivo micronucleus assay.\nBased on studies in animals, male fertility may be impaired by treatment with TAGRISSO.\nDegenerative changes were present in the testes in rats and dogs exposed to\nosimertinib for 1 month or more with evidence of reversibility in the rat. Following\nadministration of osimertinib to rats for approximately 10 weeks at a dose of 40 mg/kg,\nat exposures 0.5 times the AUC observed at the recommended clinical dose of 80 mg\nonce daily, there was a reduction in male fertility, demonstrated by increased pre-\nimplantation loss in untreated females mated to treated males.\nBased on studies in animals, female fertility may be impaired by treatment with\nTAGRISSO. In repeat dose toxicity studies, histological evidence of anestrus, corpora\nlutea degeneration in the ovaries and epithelial thinning in the uterus and vagina were\nseen in rats exposed to osimertinib for 1 month or more at exposures 0.3 times the\nAUC observed at the recommended clinical dose of 80 mg once daily. Findings in the\novaries seen following 1 month of dosing exhibited evidence of reversibility. In a female\nfertility study in rats, administration of osimertinib from 2 weeks prior to mating through\nDay 8 of gestation at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.5 times the C\n at the\nrecommended dose of 80 mg once daily) had no effects on estrous cycling or the\nnumber of females becoming pregnant, but caused early embryonic deaths. These\nfindings showed evidence of reversibility when females were mated 1 month after\ntreatment discontinuation.\n13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nAdministration of osimertinib resulted in histological findings of lens fiber degeneration in\nthe 2-year rat carcinogenicity study at \u22653 mg/kg/day (exposures 0.2 times the human\nexposure based on AUC). These findings were consistent with the ophthalmoscopic\nobservation of lens opacities, which were first noted from week 52 and showed a\ngradual increase in incidence and severity with increased duration of dosing.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 Adjuvant Treatment of Early-Stage EGFR Mutation-Positive Non-Small\nCell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)\nThe efficacy of TAGRISSO was demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled trial (ADAURA [NCT02511106]) for the adjuvant treatment of patients with\nEGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutation-positive NSCLC who had complete\ntumor resection, with or without prior adjuvant chemotherapy. Eligible patients with\nresectable tumors (stage IB \u2013 IIIA according to American Joint Commission on Cancer\n[AJCC] 7\n edition) were required to have predominantly non-squamous histology and\nEGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations identified prospectively from\ntumor tissue in a central laboratory by the cobas\n EGFR Mutation Test. Patients with\nclinically significant uncontrolled cardiac disease, prior history of ILD/pneumonitis, or\nwho received treatment with any EGFR kinase inhibitor were not eligible for the study.\nmax\nth\n\u00ae\nPatients were randomized (1:1) to receive TAGRISSO 80 mg orally once daily or placebo\nfollowing recovery from surgery and standard adjuvant chemotherapy if given. Patients\nwho did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy were randomized within 10 weeks and\npatients who received adjuvant chemotherapy were randomized within 26 weeks\nfollowing surgery. Randomization was stratified by mutation type (exon 19 deletions or\nexon 21 L858R mutations), race (Asian or non-Asian) and pTNM staging (IB or II or IIIA)\naccording to AJCC 7\n edition. Treatment was given for 3 years or until disease\nrecurrence, or unacceptable toxicity.\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was disease-free survival (DFS, defined as\nreduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death) in patients with stage II \u2013 IIIA\nNSCLC determined by investigator assessment. Additional efficacy outcome measures\nincluded DFS in the overall population (patients with stage IB \u2013 IIIA NSCLC), and overall\nsurvival (OS) in patients with stage II \u2013 IIIA NSCLC and in the overall population.\nA total of 682 patients were randomized to TAGRISSO (n=339) or placebo (n=343). The\nmedian age was 63 years (range 30-86 years); 70% were female; 64% were Asian and\n72% were never smokers. Baseline World Health Organization (WHO) performance\nstatus was 0 (64%) or 1 (36%); 31% had stage IB, 35% II, and 34% IIIA. With regard to\nEGFR mutation status, 55% were exon 19 deletions and 45% were exon 21 L858R\nmutations. The majority (60%) of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy prior to\nrandomization (27% IB; 70% II, 79% IIIA).\nADAURA demonstrated a statistically significant difference in DFS for patients treated\nwith TAGRISSO compared to patients treated with placebo. The final analysis of OS\ndemonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients treated with\nTAGRISSO compared to patients treated with placebo. Median OS was not reached in\neither arm. In the overall population (IB-IIIA), the median follow-up time was 61.5\nmonths in both treatment arms.

Patients were required to have measurable\ndisease per RECIST v1.1, a WHO performance status of 0-1, and EGFR exon 19\ndeletions or exon 21 L858R mutation in tumor prospectively identified by the cobas\nEGFR Mutation Test in a central laboratory or by an investigational assay at a CLIA-\ncertified or accredited laboratory. Patients with CNS metastases not requiring steroids\nand with stable neurologic status for at least two weeks after completion of definitive\nsurgery or radiotherapy were eligible. Patients were assessed at the investigator\u2019s\ndiscretion for CNS metastases if they had a history of, or suspected, CNS metastases at\nstudy entry.\nPatients were randomized (1:1) to receive TAGRISSO 80 mg orally once daily or to\nreceive gefitinib 250 mg orally once daily or erlotinib 150 mg orally once daily until\ndisease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by EGFR\nmutation type (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutation) and ethnicity (Asian or\nnon-Asian). Patients randomized to the control arm were offered TAGRISSO at the time\n\u00ae\nof disease progression if tumor samples tested positive for the EGFR T790M mutation.\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed\nby investigator. Additional efficacy outcome measures included OS and overall response\nrate (ORR).\nA total of 556 patients were randomized to TAGRISSO (n=279) or to control (gefitinib\nn=183; erlotinib n=94). The median age was 64 years (range 26-93 years); 54% were\n<65 years of age; 63% were female; 62% were Asian and 64% were never smokers.\nBaseline WHO performance status was 0 (41%) or 1 (59%); 5% had Stage IIIb and 95%\nhad Stage IV; and 7% received prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy as neoadjuvant\nor adjuvant therapy. With regard to EGFR tumor testing, 63% were exon 19 deletions\nand 37% were exon 21 L858R; 5 patients (<1%) also had a concomitant de novo T790M\nmutation. EGFR mutation status was confirmed centrally using the cobas\n EGFR\nMutation Test in 90% of patients. At the time of the final data cut-off, of those\nrandomized to TAGRISSO and to investigator\u2019s choice erlotinib or gefitinib arm, 133\n(48%) and 180 (65%) patients had received at least one subsequent treatment,\nrespectively. Out of the 180 patients randomized to erlotinib or gefitinib who received\nsubsequent treatment, 85 (47%) patients received TAGRISSO as first subsequent\ntherapy.\nFLAURA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients\nrandomized to TAGRISSO as compared to erlotinib or gefitinib (see Table 12 and Figure\n3). The final analysis of overall survival demonstrated a statistically significant\nimprovement in overall survival in patients randomized to TAGRISSO compared to\nerlotinib or gefitinib (see Table 12 and Figure 4).\nTable 12.

All\npatients were required to have EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC identified by the\ncobas\n EGFR Mutation Test performed in a central laboratory prior to randomization.\nA total of 419 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive TAGRISSO (n=279) or platinum-\nbased doublet chemotherapy (n=140). Randomization was stratified by ethnicity (Asian\nvs non-Asian). Patients in the TAGRISSO arm received TAGRISSO 80 mg orally once daily\nuntil intolerance to therapy, disease progression, or investigator determination that the\npatient was no longer benefiting from treatment. Patients in the chemotherapy arm\nreceived pemetrexed 500 mg/m  with carboplatin AUC5 or pemetrexed 500 mg/m  with\ncisplatin 75 mg/m  on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle for up to 6 cycles. Patients whose\ndisease had not progressed after four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy could\nhave received pemetrexed maintenance therapy (pemetrexed 500 mg/m  on Day 1 of\nevery 21-day cycle).\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was PFS according to Response Evaluation Criteria\nin Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) by investigator assessment. Additional efficacy outcome\nmeasures included ORR, DoR, and OS. Patients randomized to the chemotherapy arm\nwho had radiological progression according to both investigator and BICR were\npermitted to cross over to receive treatment with TAGRISSO.\nThe baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the overall trial population were:\nmedian age 62 years (range: 20-90 years), \u226575 years old (15%), female (64%), White\n(32%), Asian (65%), never smoker (68%), WHO performance status 0 or 1 (100%).\nFifty-four percent (54%) of patients had extra-thoracic visceral metastases, including\n34% with central nervous system (CNS) metastases (including 11% with measurable\nCNS metastases) and 23% with liver metastases. Forty-two percent (42%) of patients\nhad metastatic bone disease.\nIn AURA3, there was a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the patients\nrandomized to TAGRISSO compared to chemotherapy (see Table 16 and Figure 6). No\nstatistically significant difference was observed between the treatment arms at final OS\nanalysis. At the time of the final OS analysis, 99 patients (71%) randomized to\nchemotherapy had crossed over to TAGRISSO treatment.\nTable 16.

Febrile neutropenia\noccurred in 7% of patients. Sepsis occurred in 2% of patients and was fatal in 1% (all\ncases occurred in patients with solid tumors other than SCLC). Grade 3 or 4\nthrombocytopenia occurred in 10%, with a median time to onset of 10 days and a\nmedian duration of 7 days. Grade 3 or 4 anemia occurred in 17% of patients.\nAdminister ZEPZELCA only to patients with baseline neutrophil count of at least\n1,500 cells/mm  and platelet count of at least 100,000/mm . Monitor blood counts\nincluding neutrophil count and platelet count prior to each administration. For neutrophil\ncount less than 500 cells/mm  or any value less than lower limit of normal, the use of G-\nCSF is recommended. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue\nZEPZELCA based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].\nZEPZELCA to the Nylon membrane filters has been observed when 0.9%\nSodium Chloride Injection, USP is used as the diluent.\nCompatibility with other intravenous administration materials and the diluted\nZEPZELCA solution has been demonstrated in the following materials:\no\no\no\nPolyolefin containers (polyethylene, polypropylene and mixtures).\nPolyvinyl Chloride (PVC) (non-DEHP-containing), polyurethane and polyolefin\ninfusion sets (polyethylene, polypropylene and polybutadiene).\nImplantable venous access systems with titanium and plastic resin ports and\nwith polyurethane or silicone intravenous catheters.\nDo not co-administer ZEPZELCA and other intravenous drugs concurrently within\nthe same intravenous line.\nIf not used immediately after reconstitution or dilution, the ZEPZELCA solution can\nbe stored prior to administration for up to 24 hours following reconstitution,\nincluding infusion time, at either room temperature/ ambient light or under\nrefrigeration at 2\u00baC-8\u00baC (36\u00baF-46\u00baF) conditions.\n3\n3\n3\nZEPZELCA based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].\n5.2 Hepatotoxicity\nZEPZELCA can cause hepatotoxicity.\nIn clinical studies of 554 patients with advanced solid tumors receiving ZEPZELCA [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)], Grade 3 elevations of ALT and AST were observed in 6% and\n3% of patients, respectively, and Grade 4 elevations of ALT and AST were observed in\n0.4% and 0.5% of patients, respectively. The median time to onset of Grade \u2265 3\nelevation in transaminases was 8 days (range: 3 to 49), with a median duration of 7\ndays.\nMonitor liver function tests prior to initiating ZEPZELCA and periodically during treatment\nas clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue ZEPZELCA\nbased on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].\n5.3 Extravasation Resulting in Tissue Necrosis\nExtravasation of ZEPZELCA resulting in skin and soft tissue injury, including necrosis\nrequiring debridement, can occur. Consider use of a central venous catheter to reduce\nthe risk of extravasation, particularly in patients with limited venous access. Monitor\npatients for signs and symptoms of extravasation during the ZEPZELCA infusion. If\nextravasation occurs, immediately discontinue the infusion, remove the infusion\ncatheter, and monitor for signs and symptoms of tissue necrosis. The time to onset of\nnecrosis after extravasation may vary.\nAdminister supportive care and consult with an appropriate medical specialist as needed\nfor signs and symptoms of extravasation. Administer subsequent infusions at a site that\nwas not affected by extravasation.\n5.4 Rhabdomyolysis\nRhabdomyolysis has been reported in patients treated with ZEPZELCA. Monitor creatine\nphosphokinase (CPK) prior to initiating ZEPZELCA and periodically during treatment as\nclinically indicated. Withhold or reduce the dose based on severity [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.2)].\n5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on animal data and its mechanism of action ZEPZELCA can cause fetal harm\nwhen administered to a pregnant woman. Intravenous administration of a single dose of\nlurbinectedin (approximately 0.2 times the 3.2 mg/m  clinical dose) to pregnant animals\nduring the period of organogenesis caused 100% embryolethality in rats. Advise\npregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive\npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ZEPZELCA and for 6\nmonths after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive\npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ZEPZELCA and for 4\nmonths after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the\nlabeling:\n2\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects\nexposure to ZEPZELCA as a single agent at a dose of 3.2 mg/m  intravenously every 21\ndays in 554 patients with advanced solid tumors. Among 554 patients who received\nZEPZELCA, including 105 patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in PM1183-B-005-\n14 (Study B-005), 24% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 5% were exposed for\ngreater than one year.\nSmall Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)\nThe safety of ZEPZELCA was evaluated in a cohort of 105 patients with previously\ntreated SCLC in Study B-005 [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Patients received ZEPZELCA 3.2\nmg/m  intravenously every 21 days. All patients in this study received a pre-specified\nanti-emetic regimen consisting of a corticosteroid and serotonin antagonist. Patients\ncould receive G-CSF for secondary prophylaxis (i.e., after patients had an initial decrease\nin WBC), but not primary prophylaxis. Among patients who received ZEPZELCA, 29%\nwere exposed for 6 months or longer and 6% were exposed for greater than one year.\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 34% of patients who received ZEPZELCA. Serious\nadverse reactions in \u2265 3% of patients included pneumonia, febrile neutropenia,\nneutropenia, respiratory tract infection, anemia, dyspnea, and thrombocytopenia.\nPermanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in two patients (1.9%)\nwho received ZEPZELCA. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation in \u2265\n1% of patients who received ZEPZELCA, which included peripheral neuropathy and\nmyelosuppression.\nDosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 30.5% of patients who\nreceived ZEPZELCA.

If coadministration\ncannot be avoided, reduce the dose of ZEPZELCA [see Dosage and Administration\n(2.3)].\nModerate CYP3A Inhibitors\nAvoid coadministration of ZEPZELCA with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. If\ncoadministration cannot be avoided, consider dose reduction of ZEPZELCA if clinically\nindicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].\nStrong CYP3A Inducers\nAvoid coadministration of ZEPZELCA with strong CYP3A inducers. Coadministration of\nZEPZELCA with a strong CYP3A inducer may decrease lurbinectedin systemic exposure,\nwhich may decrease the efficacy of ZEPZELCA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on animal data and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)],\nZEPZELCA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no\navailable data to inform the risk of ZEPZELCA use in pregnant women. Intravenous\nadministration of a single lurbinectedin dose (approximately 0.2 times the 3.2 mg/m\nclinical dose) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused\nembryolethality (see Data).\nAdvise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated\npopulation is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or\nother adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk\nof major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and\n15 to 20%, respectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nIn a reproductive toxicity study, administration of a single lurbinectedin dose of 0.6\nmg/m  (approximately 0.2 times of the human dose of 3.2 mg/m ) to pregnant rats on\nGestation Day 10 resulted in 100% post-implantation loss.\n2\n2\n2\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of lurbinectedin in human milk or its effects on the\nbreastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse\nreactions from ZEPZELCA in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during\ntreatment with ZEPZELCA and for 2 weeks after the last dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nZEPZELCA can cause embryolethality at doses lower than the human dose of 3.2\nmg/m [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating\nZEPZELCA.\nContraception\nFemales\nAdvise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during\ntreatment with ZEPZELCA and for 6 months after the last dose.\nMales\nAdvise males with a female sexual partner of reproductive potential to use effective\ncontraception during treatment with ZEPZELCA and for 4 months after the last dose.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of ZEPZELCA in pediatric patients have not been\nestablished.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the 105 patients with SCLC administered ZEPZELCA in clinical studies, 37 (35%)\npatients were 65 years of age and older, while 9 (9%) patients were 75 years of age and\nolder. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between patients aged 65 and\nolder and younger patients.\nThere was a higher incidence of serious adverse reactions in patients \u2265 65 years of age\nthan in patients < 65 years of age (49% vs. 26%, respectively). The serious adverse\nreactions most frequently reported in patients \u2265 65 years of age were related to\nmyelosuppression and consisted of febrile neutropenia (11%), neutropenia (11%),\nthrombocytopenia (8%), and anemia (8%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n8.6 Hepatic Impairment\nThe effect of moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN and any\nAST) on the pharmacokinetics of lurbinectedin has not been studied. No dose\nadjustment of ZEPZELCA is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment\n(total bilirubin \u2264 ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin 1 to 1.5 \u00d7 ULN and any AST) [see\nClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n2 \n11 DESCRIPTION\nZEPZELCA is an alkylating drug. The chemical name of ZEPZELCA (lurbinectedin) is\n(1\u2019R,6R,6aR,7R,13S,14S,16R)-8,14-dihydroxy-6\u2019,9-dimethoxy-4,10,23-trimethyl-19-oxo-\n2\u2019,3\u2019,4\u2019,6,7,9\u2019,12,13,14,16-decahydro-6aH-spiro[7,13-azano-6,16-\n(epithiopropanooxymethano) [1,3]dioxolo[7,8]isoquinolino[3,2-b][3]benzazocine-20,1\u2019-\npyrido[3,4-b]indol]-5-yl acetate.\nThe molecular formula is C\nH\nN O\nS. The molecular weight is 784.87g/mol, and the\nchemical structure is:\nZEPZELCA for injection 4 mg is supplied as a lyophilized powder in a single-dose vial for\nreconstitution for intravenous use. The ZEPZELCA lyophilized formulation is comprised\nof 4 mg lurbinectedin, sucrose (800 mg), lactic acid (22.1 mg), and sodium hydroxide\n(5.1 mg). Before use, the lyophilizate is reconstituted by addition of 8 mL Sterile Water\nfor Injection USP, yielding a solution containing 0.5 mg/mL lurbinectedin (the calculated\nconcentration is 0.47 mg/mL based on the final volume of 8.5 mL).\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nLurbinectedin is an alkylating drug that binds guanine residues in the minor groove of\nDNA, forming adducts and resulting in a bending of the DNA helix towards the major\ngroove. Adduct formation triggers a cascade of events that can affect the subsequent\nactivity of DNA binding proteins, including some transcription factors, and DNA repair\npathways, resulting in perturbation of the cell cycle and eventual cell death.\n41\n44\n4\n10\nLurbinectedin inhibited human monocyte activity in vitro and reduced macrophage\ninfiltration in implanted tumors in mice.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nLurbinectedin exposure-response relationships and the pharmacodynamic time-course\nfor efficacy have not been fully characterized.\nIncreased incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and Grade \u2265 3 thrombocytopenia were\nobserved with increased lurbinectedin exposure.\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nNo large mean increase in QTc (i.e., > 20 ms) was detected at the recommended dose\nof 3.2 mg/m .\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nFollowing the approved recommended dosage, geometric mean (%CV) of plasma C\nand AUC\n, were 107 \u00b5g/L (79%) and 551 \u00b5g\u2022h/L (94%), respectively. No accumulation\nof lurbinectedin in plasma is observed upon administrations every 3 weeks.\nDistribution\nThe volume of distribution of lurbinectedin at steady state is 504 L (39%). Plasma protein\nbinding is approximately 99%, to both albumin and \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein.\nElimination\nThe terminal half-life of lurbinectedin is 51 hours. Total plasma clearance of lurbinectedin\nis 11 L/h (50%).\nMetabolism\nLurbinectedin is metabolized by CYP3A in vitro.\nExcretion\nAfter a single dose of radiolabeled lurbinectedin, 89% of the radioactivity was recovered\nin feces (< 0.2% unchanged) and 6% in urine (1% unchanged).\nSpecific Populations\nNo clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lurbinectedin were\nidentified based on age (18-85 years), sex, body weight (39-154 kg), mild to moderate\nrenal impairment (CLcr 30 to 89 mL/min) or mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin \u2264\nULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin between 1 to 1.5 \u00d7 ULN and any AST). The effects\nof severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) and moderate or severe hepatic\nimpairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN and any AST) on the pharmacokinetics of\nlurbinectedin have not been studied.\nDrug Interactions Studies\nClinical Studies\nEffects of CYP3A Inhibitors on Lurbinectedin: Coadministration of itraconazole (a strong\nCYP3A inhibitor) increased systemic exposure (AUC) of total lurbinectedin by 2.7-fold\nand unbound lurbinectedin by 2.4-fold.\n2\nmax\n0-inf\nEffects of CYP3A Inducers on Lurbinectedin: Coadministration of bosentan (a moderate\nCYP3A inducer) decreased systemic exposure (AUC) of total lurbinectedin by 20% and\nunbound lurbinectedin by 19%. These changes are not considered clinically relevant.\nIn vitro Studies\nCytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: Lurbinectedin is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6,\nCYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4.\nLurbinectedin is not an inducer of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4.\nTransporter Systems: Lurbinectedin is a substrate of MDR1, but is not a substrate of\nOATB1P1, OATP1B3, OCT1, or MATE1. Lurbinectedin inhibits MDR1, OATP1B1,\nOATP1B3, and OCT1 but not BCRP, BSEP, MATE1, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity testing of lurbinectedin has not been performed. Lurbinectedin is\ngenotoxic to mammalian cells in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.\nLurbinectedin was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay.\nFertility studies with lurbinectedin were not performed. There were no findings in\nreproductive organs in general toxicology studies in rats, dogs, or monkeys; however,\nthe highest doses and exposures in these studies were all at levels lower than those at\nthe human dose of 3.2 mg/m .\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nPM1183-B-005-14 (Study B-005; NCT02454972) is a multicenter, open-label, multi-\ncohort trial evaluating ZEPZELCA as a single agent in patients with advanced or\nmetastatic solid tumors. A cohort of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with\ndisease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy received ZEPZELCA 3.2\nmg/m  by intravenous infusion every 21 days (one cycle). Patients received a median of\n4 cycles of ZEPZELCA (range 1 to 24 cycles). The trial excluded patients with central\nnervous system (CNS) involvement, grade \u2265 3 dyspnea, daily intermittent oxygen\nrequirement, hepatitis or cirrhosis, and immunocompromised patients. Tumor\nassessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 18 weeks and every 9 weeks\nthereafter. The major efficacy outcome measure was confirmed investigator-assessed\noverall response rate (ORR). Additional efficacy outcome measures included duration of\nresponse (DoR), and an Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessed ORR using\nResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1).\nA total of 105 patients with SCLC who progressed on or after platinum-based\nchemotherapy were enrolled. The median age was 60 years (range: 40 to 83) with 65%\nof patients < 65 years and 35% of patients \u2265 65 years, and 60% were male. The\nmajority (75%) of the patients were White, 1% were Asian, 1% were Black and 23% were\nnot reported. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 or 1 in 92% of patients, and\n92% were former/current smokers. All patients received at least one line of platinum-\nbased chemotherapy (range 1-2 lines), and prior radiotherapy had been administered to\n71% of patients. Eight patients (8%) had prior immunotherapy in addition to platinum-\n2\n2\nbased chemotherapy. Sixty patients (57%) had platinum-sensitive SCLC, defined as\nrecurrence or progression \u2265 90 days after the last dose of platinum-containing therapy\n(chemotherapy free interval [CTFI] \u2265 90 days). The remaining 45 patients had platinum-\nresistant SCLC, defined as recurrence or progression < 90 days after the last dose of\nplatinum-containing therapy (CTFI < 90 days).\nTable 5 summarizes investigator-assessed and independent review committee assessed\nkey efficacy measures in all patients and in platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive\nsubgroups.\nTable 5: Efficacy Results in SCLC Cohort of Study B-005\nInvestigator\nAssessed\nResponse\nZEPZELCA\nAll Patients\n(n=105)\nZEPZELCA\nCTFI <90 days\n(n=45)\nZEPZELCA\nCTFI \u226590 days\n(n=60)\nOverall Response\nRate (95% CI)\n35% (26%, 45%)\n22% (11%, 37%)\n45% (32%, 58%)\n     Complete\nresponse\n0%\n0%\n0%\n     Partial response\n35%\n22%\n45%\nDuration of\nResponse\n     Median in months\n(95% CI)\n5.3 (4.1, 6.4)\n4.7 (2.6, 5.6)\n6.2 (3.5, 7.3)\n     % with \u22656\nmonths\n35%\n10%\n44%\nIndependent\nReview Committee\nAssessed\nResponse\nAll Patients\n(n=105)\nCTFI <90 days\n(n=45)\nCTFI \u226590 days\n(n=60)\nOverall Response\nRate (95% CI)\n30% (22%, 40%)\n13% (5%, 27%)\n43% (31%, 57%)\n     Complete\nresponse\n0%\n0%\n0%\n     Partial response\n30%\n13%\n43%\nDuration of\nResponse\n     Median in months\n(95% CI)\n5.1 (4.9, 6.4)\n4.8 (2.4, 5.3)\n5.3 (4.9, 7.0)\n     % with \u22656\nmonths\n25%\n0%\n31%\n \na\nb\n15 REFERENCES\na\nb\na\nb\nCI: confidence interval, CTFI: chemotherapy free interval.\nConfirmed overall response rate.\nBased on observed duration of response.\n1. \"OSHA Hazardous\nDrugs.\" OSHA. http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/hazardousdrugs/index.html\n16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING\nHow Supplied\nZEPZELCA (lurbinectedin) for injection is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free, white to\noff\u2011white lyophilized powder in a single-dose clear glass vial.

The time between the end of the durvalumab\ninfusion and the start of chemotherapy can be reduced to 30 minutes.\n3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nInjection: 25 mg/1.25 mL (20 mg/mL) or 300 mg/15 mL (20 mg/mL) clear to slightly\nopalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution in a single-dose vial.\n4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nNone.\n5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n5.1 Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions\nIMJUDO is a monoclonal antibody that blocks T-cell inhibitory signals induced by the\nCTLA-4 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response. In combination\nwith durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, these drugs have the potential for induction of\nimmune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed herein\nmay not be inclusive of all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions.\nImmune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any\norgan system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time\nInfuse IMJUDO first, followed by durvalumab and then platinum-based\nchemotherapy on the day of dosing.\nInfuse IMJUDO first, followed by durvalumab and then pemetrexed treatment on\nthe day of dosing.\nObserve patient for 60 minutes following completion of IMJUDO infusion [see\nWarnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Then administer durvalumab as a separate\nintravenous infusion over 60 minutes\nafter starting IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab. While immune-mediated adverse\nreactions usually manifest during treatment, immune-mediated adverse reactions can\nalso manifest after discontinuation of IMJUDO and/or durvalumab.\nEarly identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are\nessential to ensure safe use of IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab. Monitor for\nsigns and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated\nadverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine,\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and before\neach dose. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as\nappropriate.\nWithhold or permanently discontinue IMJUDO and durvalumab depending on severity\n[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. In general, if combination of IMJUDO and\ndurvalumab requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid\ntherapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or\nless. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to\ntaper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic\nimmunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not\ncontrolled with corticosteroid therapy.\nToxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require\nsystemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed\nbelow.\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis\nIMJUDO in combination with durvalumab can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis,\nwhich may be fatal.\nIMJUDO with Durvalumab\nImmune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 1.3% (5/388) of patients receiving IMJUDO in\ncombination with durvalumab, including fatal (0.3%) and Grade 3 (0.2%) adverse\nreactions. Events resolved in 3 of the 5 patients and resulted in permanent\ndiscontinuation in 1 patient. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all patients; of\nthese, 4 patients required high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone\nor equivalent per day). One patient (1/5) required other immunosuppressants.\nIMJUDO with Durvalumab and Platinum-Based Chemotherapy\nImmune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.5% (21/596) of patients receiving IMJUDO\nin combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, including fatal\n(0.5%) and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Events resolved in 11 of the 21 patients\nand resulted in permanent discontinuation in 7 patients. Systemic corticosteroids were\nrequired in all patients with immune-mediated pneumonitis, while 1 patient (1/21)\nrequired other immunosuppressants.\nImmune-Mediated Colitis\nIMJUDO in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy can cause\nimmune-mediated colitis, which may be fatal.\nIMJUDO in combination with durvalumab can cause immune-mediated colitis that is\nfrequently associated with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has\nbeen reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In\ncases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to\nexclude alternative etiologies.\nIMJUDO with Durvalumab\nImmune-mediated colitis or diarrhea occurred in 6% (23/388) of patients receiving\nIMJUDO in combination with durvalumab, including Grade 3 (3.6%) adverse reactions.\nEvents resolved in 22 of the 23 patients and resulted in permanent discontinuation in 5\npatients. All patients received systemic corticosteroids, and 20 of the 23 patients\nreceived high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent\nper day). Three patients also received other immunosuppressants.\nIntestinal perforation has been observed in other studies of IMJUDO in combination with\ndurvalumab.\nIMJUDO with Durvalumab and Platinum-Based Chemotherapy\nImmune-mediated colitis occurred in 6.5% (39/596) of patients receiving IMJUDO in\ncombination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, including fatal (0.2%)\nand Grade 3 (2.5%) adverse reactions. Events resolved in 33 of the 39 patients and\nresulted in permanent discontinuation in 11 patients. Systemic corticosteroids were\nrequired in all patients with immune-mediated colitis, while 4 patients (4/39) required\nother immunosuppressants.\nIntestinal perforation and large intestine perforation were reported in 0.1% of patients\nreceiving IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab.\nImmune-Mediated Hepatitis\nIMJUDO in combination with durvalumab can cause immune-mediated hepatitis, which\nmay be fatal.\nIMJUDO with Durvalumab\nImmune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 7.5% (29/388) of patients receiving IMJUDO in\ncombination with durvalumab, including fatal (0.8%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3\n(4.1%) adverse reactions. Events resolved in 12 of the 29 patients and resulted in\npermanent discontinuation in 9 patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all 29\npatients and all 29 patients required high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg\nprednisone or equivalent per day). Eight patients (8/29) required other\nimmunosuppressants.\nIMJUDO with Durvalumab and Platinum-Based Chemotherapy\nImmune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 3.9% (23/596) of patients receiving IMJUDO in\ncombination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, including fatal (0.3%),\nGrade 4 (0.5%), and Grade 3 (2%) adverse reactions. Events resolved in 12 of the 23\npatients and resulted in permanent discontinuation in 27 patients. Systemic\ncorticosteroids were required in all patients with immune-mediated hepatitis, while 2\npatients (2/23) required use of other immunosuppressants.\nImmune-Mediated Endocrinopathies\nAdrenal Insufficiency: IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab can cause primary or\nsecondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate\nsymptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated.

In animal studies,\nCTLA-4 blockade is associated with increased risk of immune-mediated rejection of the\ndeveloping fetus and fetal death (see Data).\nHuman immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) is known to cross the placental barrier; therefore,\nIMJUDO has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus.\nAdvise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a\nfetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nIn a reproduction study, administration of tremelimumab-actl to pregnant cynomolgus\nmonkeys during the period of organogenesis was not associated with maternal toxicity\nor effects on embryo-fetal development at exposure levels approximately 4 to 31-times\nhigher than those observed at a recommended dose range of 75 mg to 300 mg based\non area under the curve (AUC). CTLA-4 plays a role in maintaining maternal immune\ntolerance to the fetus to preserve pregnancy and in immune regulation of the newborn.\nIn a murine model of pregnancy, CTLA-4 blockade resulted in increased resorptions and\nreduced live fetuses. Mated genetically engineered mice heterozygous for CTLA-4 (CTLA-\n4+/-) gave birth to CTLA-4+/- offspring and offspring deficient in CTLA-4 (homozygous\nnegative, CTLA-4-/-) that appeared healthy at birth. The CTLA-4-/- homozygous negative\noffspring developed signs of a lymphoproliferative disorder and died by 3 to 4 weeks of\nage with multiorgan tissue destruction. Based on its mechanism of action, fetal\nexposure to tremelimumab-actl may increase the risk of developing immune-mediated\ndisorders or altering the normal immune response.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of tremelimumab-actl in human milk, its effects on a\nbreastfed child, or on milk production. Maternal IgG is known to be present in human\nmilk. The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure in the\nbreastfed child to IMJUDO are unknown. Because of the potential for serious adverse\nreactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with\nIMJUDO and for 3 months after the last dose. Refer to the Prescribing Information for\nagents administered in combination with IMJUDO for breastfeeding recommendations,\nas appropriate.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nIMJUDO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.1)].\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment\nwith IMJUDO.\nContraception\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment\nwith IMJUDO and for 3 months after the last dose. Refer to the Prescribing Information\nfor the agents administered in combination with IMJUDO for recommended\ncontraception duration, as appropriate.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of IMJUDO have not been established in pediatric patients.\nSafety and efficacy were assessed but not established in a multi-center, open-label study\n(NCT03837899) in which 41 pediatric patients aged 1 to < 17 years with advanced solid\ntumors received IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab. No new safety signals were\nobserved in pediatric patients in this study.\nTremelimumab-actl systemic exposure in pediatric patients \u2265 35 kg was within the range\nof the values previously observed in adults given the same weight-based dose, whereas\nthe systemic exposure in pediatric patients < 35 kg was lower than that of adults.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the 393 patients with uHCC treated with IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab,\n50% of patients were 65 years or older and 13% of patients were 75 years or older. No\noverall differences in safety or efficacy of IMJUDO have been observed between patients\n65 years or older and younger adult patients.\nOf the 330 patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with IMJUDO in combination with\ndurvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, 143 (43%) patients were 65 years or\nolder and 35 (11%) patients were 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or\neffectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nTremelimumab-actl, a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) blocking\nhuman IgG2 monoclonal antibody, is produced by recombinant DNA technology in NS0\ncell suspension culture and has a molecular weight of 149 kDa.\nIMJUDO (tremelimumab-actl) injection is a sterile, preservative-free, clear to slightly\nopalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution, in a single-dose vial for intravenous\ninfusion after dilution. IMJUDO contains tremelimumab-actl at a concentration of 20\nmg/mL in either a 25 mg/1.25 mL or a 300 mg/15 mL single-dose vial.\nEach mL contains 20 mg of tremelimumab-actl, and edetate disodium (0.09 mg),\nhistidine (0.68 mg), L\u2011histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (3.3 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.2\nmg), trehalose (76 mg), and Water for Injection, USP. The pH is approximately 5.5.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nCTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. Tremelimumab-actl is a monoclonal\nantibody that binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction with its ligands CD80 and\nCD86, releasing CTLA-4-mediated inhibition of T-cell activation. In synergistic mouse\ntumor models, blocking CTLA-4 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth and\nincreased proliferation of T cells in tumors.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nThe exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for\nthe safety and effectiveness of tremelimumab-actl have not been fully characterized.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab-actl was studied in patients with other solid\ntumors following administration of doses 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg (1- to 10-\ntimes the approved recommended dosage) administered once every 4 weeks for 4\ndoses. The pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab-actl as a single dose of 300 mg were\nevaluated in patients with HCC.\nThe AUC of tremelimumab-actl increased proportionally from 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg every\n4 weeks (1 to 10-times the approved recommended dosage) and steady state was\nachieved at approximately 12 weeks.\nDistribution\nThe geometric mean (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) of tremelimumab-actl for central\n(V1) and peripheral (V2) volume of distribution was 3.45 (24%) and 2.66 (34%) L,\nrespectively.\nElimination\nThe geometric mean (CV%) terminal half-life of tremelimumab-actl was 16.9 days (19%)\nafter a single dose and 18.2 days (19%) during steady state. The geometric mean (CV%)\nclearance of tremelimumab-actl was 0.286 L/day (32%) after a single dose and 0.263\nL/day (32%) during steady state.\nSpecific Populations\nThere were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab-\nactl based on body weight (34 to149 kg), age (18 to 87 years), sex, race (White, Black,\nAsian, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, or American Indian), serum albumin levels (0.3 to\n396 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase levels (12 to 5570 U/L), soluble PD-L1 (67 to 349\npg/mL), tumor type (NSCLC, HCC), organ dysfunction including mild to moderate renal\nimpairment (CLcr 30 to 89 mL/min), and mild to moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin <\n3 x ULN and any AST).\nThe effect of severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min) or severe hepatic\nimpairment (bilirubin > 3 x ULN and any AST) on the pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab-\nactl is unknown.\n12.6 Immunogenicity\nThe observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) is highly dependent on the\nsensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude\nmeaningful comparisons of the incidence of ADA in the studies described below with the\nincidence of ADA in other studies, including those of tremelimumab-actl.\nIn the HIMALAYA study, of the 182 patients who were treated with a single dose of\ntremelimumab-actl in combination with durvalumab once in every 4 weeks therapy and\nevaluable for the presence of ADAs against tremelimumab-actl at predose week 0 and\nweek 4, 11% (20/182) of patients tested positive for anti-tremelimumab-actl antibodies.\nAmong the 20 patients who tested positive for ADAs 40% (8/20) tested positive for\nneutralizing antibodies against tremelimumab-actl. There was no identified clinically\nsignificant effect of anti-tremelimumab-actl antibodies on the pharmacokinetics or safety\nof tremelimumab-actl; however, the effect of ADAs and neutralizing antibodies on the\neffectiveness of tremelimumab-actl is unknown.\nIn the POSEIDON study, of the 278 ADA-evaluable patients who were treated with\nIMJUDO 75 mg for up to five doses in combination with durvalumab 1,500 mg and\nplatinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks and evaluated for presence of ADAs\nagainst tremelimumab-actl at pre-dose week 0, week 3, and week 12, 14% (38/278) of\npatients tested positive for anti-tremelimumab-actl antibodies. Among the 38 patients\nwho tested positive for ADAs, 82% (31/38) tested positive for neutralizing antibodies\nagainst tremelimumab-actl. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-\ntremelimumab-actl antibodies on pharmacokinetics or safety of tremelimumab-actl,\nhowever, the effect of ADAs on effectiveness of tremelimumab-actl is unknown.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nThe carcinogenic and genotoxic potential of tremelimumab-actl have not been evaluated.\nAnimal fertility studies have not been conducted with tremelimumab-actl.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)\nUnresectable HCC - HIMALAYA\nThe efficacy of IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab was evaluated in the HIMALAYA\nstudy (NCT03298451), a randomized (1:1:1), open-label, multicenter study in patients\nwith confirmed uHCC who had not received prior systemic treatment for HCC. Patients\nwere randomized to one of two investigational arms (IMJUDO plus durvalumab or\ndurvalumab) or sorafenib. Study treatment consisted of IMJUDO as a one-time single\nintravenous infusion of 300 mg in combination with durvalumab 1,500 mg on the same\nday, followed by durvalumab every 4 weeks; durvalumab 1,500 mg every 4 weeks; or\nsorafenib 400 mg given orally twice daily, until disease progression or unacceptable\ntoxicity. The efficacy assessment of IMJUDO is based on patients randomized to the\nIMJUDO plus durvalumab arm versus the sorafenib arm. Randomization was stratified by\nmacrovascular invasion (MVI) (yes or no), etiology of liver disease (hepatitis B virus vs.\nhepatitis C virus vs. others) and ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1).\nThe study enrolled patients with BCLC Stage C or B (not eligible for locoregional therapy).\nThe study excluded patients with co-infection of viral hepatitis B and hepatitis C; active\nor prior documented gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within 12 months; ascites requiring\nnon-pharmacologic intervention within 6 months; hepatic encephalopathy within 12\nmonths before the start of treatment; active or prior documented autoimmune or\ninflammatory disorders. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was not mandated prior to\nenrollment but adequate endoscopic therapy, according to institutional standards, was\nrequired for patients with a history of esophageal variceal bleeding or those assessed as\nhigh risk for esophageal variceal bleeding by the treating physician.\nStudy treatment was permitted beyond disease progression if the patient was clinically\nstable and was deriving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator.\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS) between the IMJUDO plus\ndurvalumab arm versus the sorafenib arm. Additional efficacy outcomes were\ninvestigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR)\nand duration of response (DoR) according to RECIST v1.1. Tumor assessments were\nconducted every 8 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter.\nThe baseline demographics of the IMJUDO plus durvalumab and sorafenib arms were as\nfollows: male (85%), age < 65 years (50%), median age of 65 years (range: 18 to 88\nyears), White (46%), Asian (49%), Black or African American (2%), Native Hawaiian or\nother Pacific Islander (0.1%), race Unknown (2%), Hispanic or Latino (5%), Not Hispanic\nor Latino (94%), ethnicity Unknown (1%), ECOG PS 0 (62%); Child-Pugh Class score A\n(99%), macrovascular invasion (26%), extrahepatic spread (53%), viral etiology hepatitis\nB (31%), hepatitis C (27%), uninfected (42%).\nEfficacy results are presented in Table 9 and Figure 1.\nTable 9.

Eligible patients had Eastern\nCooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1 and must have had\nno prior chemotherapy or any other systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC. Choice of\nplatinum-based chemotherapy was at the Investigator\u2019s discretion, taking into\nconsideration the calculated creatinine clearance. Patients with active and/or untreated\nbrain metastases; a history of active primary immunodeficiency; autoimmune disorders\nincluding active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders; use of\nsystemic immunosuppressants within 14 days before the first dose of the treatment\nexcept physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids were ineligible.\nRandomization was stratified by tumor cells (TC) PD-L1 expression (TC \u2265 50% vs. TC <\n50%), disease stage (Stage IVA vs. Stage IVB), and histology (non-squamous vs.\nsquamous).\nPatients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab and\nplatinum-based chemotherapy according to the regimens listed below, durvalumab and\nplatinum-based chemotherapy (an unapproved regimen for metastatic NSCLC), or\nplatinum-based chemotherapy. The evaluation of efficacy for metastatic NSCLC relied on\ncomparison between:\n\u2022\n\u2022\nPatients received IMJUDO and durvalumab in combination with one of the following\nplatinum-based chemotherapy regimens:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nIMJUDO was given up to a maximum of 5 doses. Durvalumab and histology-based\nIMJUDO 75 mg (or 1mg/kg for patients < 30kg) with durvalumab 1,500 mg and\nplatinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by durvalumab\n1,500 mg every 4 weeks as a single agent. A fifth dose of IMJUDO 75 mg (or\n1mg/kg for patients < 30kg) was given at Week 16 in combination with durvalumab\ndose 6.\nPlatinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks as monotherapy for 4 cycles.\nPatients could receive an additional 2 cycles (a total of 6 cycles post-\nrandomization), as clinically indicated, at Investigator\u2019s discretion.\nNon-squamous NSCLC\n\u2022\nPemetrexed 500 mg/m  with carboplatin AUC 5-6 or cisplatin 75 mg/m  every\n3 weeks for 4 cycles\n2\n2\nSquamous NSCLC\n\u2022\nGemcitabine 1,000 or 1,250 mg/m  on Days 1 and 8 with cisplatin 75 mg/m\nor carboplatin AUC 5-6 on Day 1 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles\n2\n2\nNon-squamous and Squamous NSCLC\n\u2022\nNab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m  on Days 1, 8, and 15 with carboplatin AUC 5-6 on\nDay 1 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles\n2\npemetrexed continued every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\nAdministration of durvalumab monotherapy was permitted beyond disease progression\nif the patient was clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as determined by the\nInvestigator. Patients with disease progression during durvalumab monotherapy were\ngiven the option to be retreated with 4 additional cycles of IMJUDO in combination with\ndurvalumab. Tumor assessments were performed at Week 6, Week 12, and then every\n8 weeks thereafter.\nThe major efficacy outcome measures were progression free survival (PFS) and overall\nsurvival (OS) of IMJUDO and durvalumab in combination with platinum-based\nchemotherapy compared to platinum-based chemotherapy alone. Additional efficacy\noutcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR).\nPFS, ORR, and DoR were assessed using Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR)\naccording to RECIST v1.1.\nA total of 675 patients were randomized to receive either IMJUDO with durvalumab and\nplatinum-based chemotherapy (n=338) or platinum-based chemotherapy (n=337).

There are no available clinical data on the use of MEKTOVI during\npregnancy. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of binimetinib during the\nperiod of organogenesis was embryotoxic and an abortifacient in rabbits at doses\ngreater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 5 times the human\nexposure at the clinical dose of 45 mg twice daily (see Data). Advise pregnant women\nand females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nIn reproductive toxicity studies, administration of binimetinib to rats during the period of\norganogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity, decreased fetal weights and increased\nvariations in ossification at doses \u226530 mg/kg/day (approximately 37 times the human\nexposure based on AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 45 mg twice daily). In\npregnant rabbits, administration of binimetinib during the period of organogenesis\nresulted in maternal toxicity, decreased fetal body weights, an increase in\nmalformations, and increased post-implantation loss, including total loss of pregnancy at\ndoses \u226510 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 times the human exposure based on AUC at the\nrecommended clinical dose of 45 mg twice daily). There was a significant increase in fetal\nventricular septal defects and pulmonary trunk alterations at 20 mg/kg/day of binimetinib\n(less than 8 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 45 mg\ntwice daily).\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of binimetinib or its active metabolite in human milk,\nor the effects of binimetinib on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production.\nBecause of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise\nwomen not to breastfeed during treatment with MEKTOVI and for 3 days after the last\ndose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nBased on animal data, MEKTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant\nwoman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating\nMEKTOVI [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nContraception\nFemales\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment\nwith MEKTOVI and for 30 days after the last dose.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of MEKTOVI have not been established in pediatric patients.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the 690 patients with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma who received MEKTOVI in\ncombination with encorafenib across multiple clinical trials, 20% were aged 65 to 74\nyears and 8% were aged 75 years and older [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nOf the 98 patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC who received\nMEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib, 62 (63.2%) were 65 years of age and over\nand 20 (20.4%) were 75 years and over [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].\nNo overall differences in the safety or effectiveness of MEKTOVI plus encorafenib were\nobserved in older patients as compared to younger patients.\n8.6 Hepatic Impairment\nBinimetinib concentrations may increase in patients with moderate or severe hepatic\nimpairment. Dose adjustment for MEKTOVI is not recommended in patients with mild\nhepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1 and \u22641.5 \u00d7 ULN and any AST or total bilirubin \u2264\nULN and AST > ULN). Reduce the dose of MEKTOVI for patients with moderate (total\nbilirubin >1.5 and \u22643 \u00d7 ULN and any AST) or severe (total bilirubin levels >3 \u00d7 ULN and\nany AST) hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology\n(12.3)].\n10 OVERDOSAGE\nSince binimetinib is 97% bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is likely to be ineffective\nin the treatment of overdose with MEKTOVI.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nBinimetinib is a kinase inhibitor. The chemical name is 5-[(4-bromo-2-\nfluorophenyl)amino]-4-fluoro-N-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-1-methyl-1H-benzimidazole-6-\ncarboxamide. The molecular formula is C\nH\nBrF N O  and the molecular weight is\n441.2 daltons. The chemical structure of binimetinib is shown below:\n17\n15\n2\n4\n3\nBinimetinib is a white to slightly yellow powder. In aqueous media, binimetinib is slightly\nsoluble at pH 1, very slightly soluble at pH 2, and practically insoluble at pH 4.5 and\nhigher.\nMEKTOVI (binimetinib) tablets for oral use contain 15 mg of binimetinib with the following\ninactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose\nsodium, magnesium stearate (vegetable source), and colloidal silicon dioxide. The\ncoating contains polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, talc, ferric oxide\nyellow, and ferrosoferric oxide.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nBinimetinib is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal regulated\nkinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 activity. MEK proteins are upstream regulators of the\nextracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway. In vitro, binimetinib inhibited\nextracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in cell-free assays as well as\nviability and MEK-dependent phosphorylation of BRAF-mutant human melanoma cell\nlines. Binimetinib also inhibited in vivo ERK phosphorylation and tumor growth in BRAF-\nmutant murine xenograft models.\nBinimetinib and encorafenib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK\npathway. Compared to either drug alone, coadministration of encorafenib and\nbinimetinib resulted in greater anti-proliferative activity in vitro in BRAF mutation-positive\ncell lines and greater anti-tumor activity with respect to tumor growth inhibition in BRAF\nV600E mutant human melanoma xenograft studies in mice. Additionally, the combination\nof binimetinib and encorafenib delayed the emergence of resistance in BRAF V600E\nmutant human melanoma xenografts in mice compared to either drug alone. In a BRAF\nV600E mutant NSCLC patient-derived xenograft model in mice, coadministration of\nencorafenib and binimetinib resulted in greater anti-tumor activity compared to\nbinimetinib alone, with respect to tumor growth inhibition. Increased tumor growth delay\nafter dosing cessation was also observed with the coadministration compared to either\ndrug alone.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nFollowing MEKTOVI 45 mg twice daily, no clinically meaningful QT prolongation was\nobserved.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of binimetinib was studied in healthy subjects and patients with\nsolid tumors. After twice-daily dosing, the accumulation is 1.5-fold and the coefficient of\nvariation (CV%) of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) is <40% at steady\nstate. The systemic exposure of binimetinib is approximately dose proportional.\nAbsorption\nAfter oral administration, at least 50% of the binimetinib dose was absorbed with a\nmedian time to maximum concentration (T\n) of 1.6 hours.\nEffect of Food\nThe administration of a single dose of MEKTOVI 45 mg with a high-fat, high-calorie meal\n(consisting of approximately 150 calories from protein, 350 calories from carbohydrate,\nand 500 calories from fat) in healthy subjects had no effect on binimetinib exposure.\nDistribution\nBinimetinib is 97% bound to human plasma proteins and the blood-to-plasma ratio is\n0.72. The geometric mean (CV%) of apparent volume of distribution of binimetinib is 92\nL (45%).\nElimination\nThe mean (CV%) terminal half-life (t\n) of binimetinib is 3.5 hours (28.5%) and apparent\nclearance (CL/F) is 20.2 L/h (24%).\nMetabolism\nThe primary metabolic pathway is glucuronidation with UGT1A1 contributing up to 61%\nof the binimetinib metabolism. Other pathways of binimetinib metabolism include N-\ndealkylation, amide hydrolysis, and loss of ethane-diol from the side chain. The active\nmetabolite M3 produced by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 represents 8.6% of the binimetinib\nexposure. Following a single oral dose of 45 mg radiolabeled binimetinib, approximately\n60% of the circulating radioactivity AUC in plasma was attributable to binimetinib.\nExcretion\nFollowing a single oral dose of 45 mg radiolabeled binimetinib in healthy subjects, 62%\n(32% unchanged) of the administered dose was recovered in the feces while 31% (6.5%\nunchanged) was recovered in the urine.\nSpecific Populations\nAge (20 to 94 years), sex, or body weight do not have a clinically important effect on the\nsystemic exposure of binimetinib. The effect of race or ethnicity on the\npharmacokinetics of binimetinib is unknown.\nHepatic Impairment: No clinically meaningful changes in binimetinib exposure (AUC and\nC\n) were observed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1 and\n\u22641.5 \u00d7 ULN and any AST or total bilirubin \u2264 ULN and AST > ULN) as compared to\nmax\n1/2\nmax\nsubjects with normal liver function (total bilirubin \u2264 ULN and AST \u2264 ULN). A 2-fold\nincrease in AUC was observed in subjects with moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 and \u22643 \u00d7\nULN and any AST) or severe (total bilirubin levels >3 \u00d7 ULN and any AST) hepatic\nimpairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\nRenal Impairment: In subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR \u226429 mL/min/1.73 m ),\nno clinically important changes in binimetinib exposure were observed as compared to\nsubjects with normal renal function.\nDrug Interaction Studies\nClinical Studies\nEffect of UGT1A1 Inducers or Inhibitors on Binimetinib: UGT1A1 genotype and smoking\n(UGT1A1 inducer) do not have a clinically important effect on binimetinib exposure.\nSimulations predict similar C\n of binimetinib 45 mg in the presence or absence of\natazanavir 400 mg (UGT1A1 inhibitor).\nNo differences in binimetinib exposure have been observed when MEKTOVI is\ncoadministered with encorafenib.\nEffect of Binimetinib on CYP Substrates: Binimetinib did not alter the exposure of a\nsensitive CYP3A4 substrate (midazolam).\nEffect of Acid Reducing Agents on Binimetinib: The extent of binimetinib exposure (AUC)\nwas not altered in the presence of a gastric acid reducing agent (rabeprazole).\nIn Vitro Studies\nEffect of Binimetinib on CYP Substrates: Binimetinib is not a time-dependent inhibitor of\nCYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 or CYP3A.\nEffect of Transporters on Binimetinib: Binimetinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)\nand breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Binimetinib is not a substrate of organic\nanion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1) or organic cation\ntransporter 1 (OCT1).\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies with binimetinib have not been conducted. Binimetinib was not\ngenotoxic in studies evaluating reverse mutations in bacteria, chromosomal aberrations\nin mammalian cells, or micronuclei in bone marrow of rats.\nNo dedicated fertility studies have been conducted with binimetinib in animals. In general\ntoxicology studies in rats and monkeys, there were no remarkable findings in male or\nfemale reproductive organs.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic\nMelanoma\n2\nmax\nMEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib was evaluated in a randomized, active-\ncontrolled, open-label, multicenter trial (COLUMBUS; NCT01909453). Eligible patients\nwere required to have BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or\nmetastatic melanoma, as detected using the bioMerieux THxID\u2122BRAF assay. Patients\nwere permitted to have received immunotherapy in the adjuvant setting and one prior\nline of immunotherapy for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. Prior use\nof BRAF inhibitors or MEK inhibitors was prohibited. Randomization was stratified by\nAmerican Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage (IIIB, IIIC, IVM1a or IVM1b, versus\nIVM1c), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 versus 1),\nand prior immunotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease (yes versus no).\nPatients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive MEKTOVI 45 mg twice daily in combination\nwith encorafenib 450 mg once daily (MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib),\nencorafenib 300 mg once daily, or vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily. Treatment continued\nuntil disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Only the results of the approved\ndosing (MEKTOVI 45 mg in combination with encorafenib 450 mg) are described below.\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed\nby a blinded independent central review, to compare MEKTOVI in combination with\nencorafenib with vemurafenib. Additional efficacy measures included overall survival\n(OS), as well as objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) which\nwere assessed by central review.\nA total of 577 patients were randomized, 192 to the MEKTOVI in combination with\nencorafenib arm, 194 to the encorafenib arm, and 191 to the vemurafenib arm. Of the\n383 patients randomized to either the MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib or the\nvemurafenib arms, the median age was 56 years (20 to 89 years), 59% were male, 91%\nwere White, and 72% had baseline ECOG performance status of 0. Ninety-five percent\n(95%) had metastatic disease, 65% were Stage IVM1c, and 4% received prior CTLA-4,\nPD-1, or PD-L1 directed antibodies. Twenty-eight percent (28%) had elevated baseline\nserum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 45% had \u22653 organs with tumor involvement at\nbaseline, and 3% had brain metastases. Based on centralized testing, 100% of patients\u2019\ntumors tested positive for BRAF mutations; BRAF V600E (88%), BRAF V600K (11%), or\nboth (<1%).\nMEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib demonstrated a statistically significant\nimprovement in PFS compared to vemurafenib.

Eligible patients had a diagnosis of\nhistologically-confirmed metastatic NSCLC with BRAF V600E mutation that was\ntreatment-na\u00efve or had been previously treated with 1 prior line of systemic therapy in\nthe metastatic setting (platinum-based chemotherapy and/or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies),\nage 18 years or older, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status\n(PS) of 0 or 1, and measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in\nSolid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Prior use of BRAF inhibitors or MEK inhibitors was not\nallowed.\nPatients received MEKTOVI 45 mg orally twice daily and encorafenib 450 mg once daily\nuntil disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome\nmeasures were objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 and duration of\nresponse (DoR) as assessed by independent review committee (IRC).\nIn the efficacy population, BRAF V600E mutation status was determined by prospective\nlocal testing using tumor tissue (78%) or blood (22%) specimens. Of the 98 patients\nwith BRAF V600E mutation, 6 patients were enrolled into the trial based on testing of\ntheir tumor tissue specimens with the FoundationOne CDx tissue test. Of the remaining\n92 patients enrolled based on local testing, 68 patients had their tumor tissue specimens\nretrospectively confirmed as having BRAF V600E positive status by the FoundationOne\nCDx tissue test. The remaining patients had either BRAF V600E negative status (n=5) or\nhad unevaluable results (n=19) by the FoundationOne CDx tissue test. In addition,\nplasma samples from 81 out of 98 patients were retrospectively tested using the\nFoundationOne Liquid CDx assay. Of the 81 patients, 48 were confirmed positive for\nBRAF V600E, while 33 patients were BRAF V600E mutation negative by FoundationOne\nLiquid CDx assay. The remaining 17 samples had unevaluable results with\nFoundationOne Liquid CDx assay.\nThe efficacy population included 59 treatment-na\u00efve patients and 39 previously-treated\npatients. Among these 98 patients, the median age was 70 years (range: 47 to 86); 53%\nfemale; 88% White, 7% Asian, 3% Black or African American, and 1% American Indian or\nAlaska Native; 99% were not Hispanic or Latino; 13% were current smokers and 57%\nwere former smokers; 73% had ECOG PS of 1; and 97% had adenocarcinoma. All\npatients had metastatic disease and 8% had brain metastases at baseline.\nEfficacy results for patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC are\nsummarized in Table 8.\nTable 8: Efficacy Results for PHAROS\nMEKTOVI with encorafenib\nEfficacy Parameter\nTreatment na\u00efve\n(N=59)\nPreviously treated\n(N=39)\nObjective Response\nRate\n    ORR (95% CI)\n75% (62, 85)\n46% (30, 63)\n    CR\n15%\n10%\n*\nCI = Confidence interval; CR = Complete response; DoR = Duration of response; N =\nNumber of patients; NE = Not estimable; ORR = Objective response rate; PR = Partial\nresponse.\n*\n    PR\n59%\n36%\nDuration of Response\nN=44\nN=18\n    Median DoR, months\n    (95% CI)\nNE (23.1, NE)\n16.7 (7.4, NE)\n    % with DoR \u22656 months\n75%\n67%\n    % with DoR \u226512 months\n59%\n33%\n16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING\nMEKTOVI (binimetinib) is supplied as 15 mg yellow/dark yellow, unscored biconvex oval\nfilm-coated tablets debossed with a stylized \"A\" on one side and \"15\" on the other side,\navailable in bottles of 180 tablets (NDC 70255-010-02).\nStore at 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F); excursions permitted between 15\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C\n(59\u00b0F and 86\u00b0F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].\n17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\nInform patients of the following:\nNew Primary Malignancies\nAdvise patients that MEKTOVI administered with encorafenib can result in the\ndevelopment of new primary cutaneous and non-cutaneous malignancies.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time\nafter starting a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. While immune-mediated adverse\nreactions usually manifest during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies,\nimmune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-\nL1 blocking antibodies.\nEarly identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are\nessential to ensure safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor patients closely\nfor symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-\nmediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at\nbaseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated\nadverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including\ninfection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as\nappropriate.\nWithhold or permanently discontinue TECENTRIQ depending on severity [see Dosage\nand Administration (2.3)]. In general, if TECENTRIQ requires interruption or\ndiscontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day\nprednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to\nGrade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month.\nConsider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose\nimmune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.\nToxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require\nsystemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed\nbelow.\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis\nTECENTRIQ can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis.

Severe or fatal\ncases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions.\nCardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis.\nNervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic\nsyndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, nerve\nparesis, autoimmune neuropathy.\nOcular: Uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases\ncan be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment,\nincluding blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-\nmediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this\nmay require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision\nloss.\nGastrointestinal: Pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels,\ngastritis, duodenitis.\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis and\nassociated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic.\nEndocrine: Hypoparathyroidism.\nOther (Hematologic/Immune): Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic\nlymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing\nlymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura,\nsolid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection.\n5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions\nTECENTRIQ can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Monitor for\nsigns and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt, slow the rate of, or\npermanently discontinue TECENTRIQ based on the severity [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3)]. For Grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reactions, consider using pre-\nmedications with subsequent doses.\nIn clinical studies enrolling 2616 patients with various cancers who received TECENTRIQ\nas a single-agent [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], infusion-related reactions occurred in\n1.3% of patients, including Grade 3 (0.2%). The frequency and severity of infusion-\nrelated reactions were similar whether TECENTRIQ was given as a single-agent in\npatients with various cancers, in combination with other antineoplastic drugs in NSCLC\nand SCLC, and across the recommended dose range (840 mg Q2W to 1680 mg Q4W).\n5.3 Complications of Allogeneic HSCT after PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors\nFatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic\nhematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-\n1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-\nversus-host disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive\ndisease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile\nsyndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur\ndespite intervening therapy between PD-1/PD-L1 blockage and allogeneic HSCT.\nFollow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene\npromptly. Consider the benefits versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking\nantibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.\n5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on its mechanism of action, TECENTRIQ can cause fetal harm when administered\nto a pregnant woman. There are no available data on the use of TECENTRIQ in pregnant\nwomen. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway\ncan lead to increased risk of immune-related rejection of the developing fetus resulting in\nfetal death.\nVerify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating\nTECENTRIQ. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus.\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment\nwith TECENTRIQ and for at least 5 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific\nPopulations (8.1, 8.3)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the\nlabeling:\nSevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions\n(5.1)]\nInfusion-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nComplications of Allogeneic HSCT after PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors [see Warnings and\nPrecautions (5.3)]\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe data described in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to TECENTRIQ\nas a single-agent in 2616 patients in two randomized, active-controlled studies (POPLAR,\nOAK) and three open-label, single arm studies (PCD4989g, BIRCH, FIR) which enrolled\n1636 patients with metastatic NSCLC, and 980 patients with other tumor types.\nTECENTRIQ was administered at a dose of 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks in all\nstudies except PCD4989g. Among the 2616 patients who received a single-agent\nTECENTRIQ, 36% were exposed for longer than 6 months and 20% were exposed for\nlonger than 12 months. Using the dataset described for patients who received\nTECENTRIQ as a single-agent, the most common adverse reactions in \u2265 20% of patients\nwere fatigue/asthenia (48%), decreased appetite (25%), nausea (24%), cough (22%),\nand dyspnea (22%). In addition, the data reflect exposure to TECENTRIQ as a single\nagent as adjuvant therapy in 495 patients with early stage NSCLC enrolled in a\nrandomized study (IMpower010).\nIn addition, the data reflect exposure to TECENTRIQ in combination with other\nantineoplastic drugs in 2421 patients with NSCLC (N = 2223) or SCLC (N = 198) enrolled\nin five randomized, active-controlled trials, including IMpower150, IMpower130 and\nIMpower133. Among the 2421 patients, 53% were exposed to TECENTRIQ for longer\nthan 6 months and 29% were exposed to TECENTRIQ for longer than 12 months.\nAmong the 2421 patients with NSCLC and SCLC who received TECENTRIQ in\ncombination with other antineoplastic drugs, the most common adverse reactions in\n\u226520% of patients were fatigue/asthenia (49%), nausea (38%), alopecia (35%),\nconstipation (29%), diarrhea (28%) and decreased appetite (27%).\nThe data also reflect exposure to TECENTRIQ administered in combination with\ncobimetinib and vemurafenib in 230 patients enrolled in IMspire150. Among the 230\npatients, 62% were exposed to TECENTRIQ for longer than 6 months and 42% were\nexposed to TECENTRIQ for longer than 12 months.\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)\nAdjuvant Treatment of Early-stage NSCLC\nIMpower010\nThe safety of TECENTRIQ was evaluated in IMpower010, a multicenter, open-label,\nrandomized trial for the adjuvant treatment of patients with stage IB (tumors \u2265 4 cm) -\nIIIA NSCLC who had complete tumor resection and received up to 4 cycles of cisplatin-\nbased adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients received TECENTRIQ 1200 mg every 3 weeks\n(n=495) for 1 year (16 cycles), unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity\noccurred, or best supportive care [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The median number of\ncycles received was 16 (range: 1, 16).\nFatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.8% of patients receiving TECENTRIQ; these\nincluded multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, pneumothorax, interstitial lung disease,\narrhythmia, acute cardiac failure, myocarditis, cerebrovascular accident, death of\nunknown cause, and acute myeloid leukemia (1 patient each).\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 18% of patients receiving TECENTRIQ. The most\nfrequent serious adverse reactions (>1%) were pneumonia (1.8%), pneumonitis (1.6%),\nand pyrexia (1.2%).\nTECENTRIQ was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 18% of patients; the most\ncommon adverse reactions (\u22651%) leading to TECENTRIQ discontinuation were\npneumonitis (2.2%), hypothyroidism (1.6%), increased aspartate aminotranferase\n(1.4%), arthralgia (1.0%), and increased alanine aminotransferase (1.0%).\nAdverse reactions leading to interruption of TECENTRIQ occurred in 29% of patients; the\nmost common (>1%) were rash (3.0%), hyperthyroidism (2.8%), hypothyroidism\n(1.6%), increased AST (1.6%), pyrexia (1.6%), increased ALT (1.4%), upper respiratory\ntract infection (1.4%), headache (1.2%), peripheral neuropathy (1.2%), and pneumonia\n(1.2%).\nTables 4 and 5 summarize adverse reactions and selected laboratory abnormalities in\npatients receiving TECENTRIQ in IMpower010.\nTable 4: Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u226510% of Patients\nwith Early Stage NSCLC Receiving TECENTRIQ in\nIMpower010\nAdverse Reaction\nTECENTRIQ\nN = 495\nBest Supportive\nCare\nN = 495\nAll\nGrades\n(%)\nGrades\n3\u20134\n(%)\nAll\nGrades\n(%)\nGrades\n3\u20134\n(%)\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\n#\n\u00de\n\u00df\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue\nRash\n17\n1.2\n1.4\n0\nPruritus\n10\n0\n0.6\n0\nEndocrine Disorders\nHypothyroidism\n14\n0\n0.6\n0\nRespiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal\nCough\n16\n0\n11\n0\nGeneral\nPyrexia\n14\n0.8\n2.2\n0.2\nFatigue\n14\n0.6\n5\n0.2\nNervous System Disorders\nPeripheral\nneuropathy\n12\n0.4\n7\n0.2\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue\nMusculoskeletal\npain\n14\n0.8\n9\n0.2\nArthralgia\n11\n0.6\n6\n0\n*\nGraded per NCI CTCAE v4.0\nIncludes rash, dermatitis, genital rash, skin exfoliation, rash maculo-\npapular, rash erythematous, rash papular, lichen planus, eczema\nasteatotic, dermatitis exfoliative, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia\nsyndrome, dyshidrotic eczema, eczema, drug eruption, rash pruritic,\ntoxic skin eruption, dermatitis acneiform\nIncludes hypothyroidism, autoimmune hypothyroidism, primary\nhypothyroidism, blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased\nProductive cough, upper airway cough syndrome, cough\nIncludes pyrexia, body temperature increased, hyperthermia\nIncludes fatigue, asthenia\nIncludes paraesthesia, neuropathy peripheral, peripheral sensory\nneuropathy, hypoaesthesia, polyneuropathy, dysaesthesia, neuralgia,\naxonal neuropathy\nIncludes myalgia, bone pain, back pain, spinal pain, musculoskeletal\nchest pain, pain in extremity, neck pain, non-cardiac chest pain,\nmusculoskeletal discomfort, musculoskeletal stiffness, musculoskeletal\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\n#\n\u00de\n\u00df\n\u00e0\n\u00e0\nTable 5: Laboratory Abnormalities Worsening from\nBaseline Occurring in \u226520% of Patients with Early Stage\nNSCLC Receiving TECENTRIQ in IMpower010\nLaboratory\nAbnormality\nTECENTRIQ\nBest Supportive\nCare\nAll\nGrades\n(%)\nGrades\n3\u20134\n(%)\nAll\nGrades\n(%)\nGrades\n3\u20134\n(%)\n*\n\u2020\nChemistry\nIncreased aspartate\naminotransferase\n34\n2.5\n18\n0\nIncreased alanine\naminotransferase\n30\n3.3\n19\n0.4\nHyperkalemia\n24\n3.5\n15\n2.5\nIncreased blood\ncreatinine\n31\n0.2\n23\n0.2\nMetastatic Chemotherapy-Na\u00efve NSCLC\nIMpower110\nThe safety of TECENTRIQ was evaluated in IMpower110, a multicenter, international,\nrandomized, open-label study in 549 chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients with stage IV NSCLC,\nincluding those with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of\nuncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a\ncausal relationship to drug exposure.\nCardiac: pericarditis, pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\n*\n\u2020\nLaboratory tests which do not have NCI CTCAE grading criteria are also included for All\nGrade assessments, which were performed by comparing to respective lab normal\nranges.\nThe denominators used to calculate the rate varied from 4-49 for all tests of interest\nbased on the number of patients with a baseline value and at least one on-study\nlaboratory measurement available.\nBased on its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)], TECENTRIQ can\ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data\non the use of TECENTRIQ in pregnant women.\nAnimal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway can lead to\nincreased risk of immune-related rejection of the developing fetus resulting in fetal death\n(see Data). Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with TECENTRIQ to evaluate its\neffect on reproduction and fetal development. A literature-based assessment of the\neffects on reproduction demonstrated that a central function of the PD-L1/PD-1\npathway is to preserve pregnancy by maintaining maternal immune tolerance to a fetus.\nBlockage of PD-L1 signaling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt\ntolerance to a fetus and to result in an increase in fetal loss; therefore, potential risks of\nadministering TECENTRIQ during pregnancy include increased rates of abortion or\nstillbirth. As reported in the literature, there were no malformations related to the\nblockade of PD-L1/PD-1 signaling in the offspring of these animals; however, immune-\nmediated disorders occurred in PD-1 and PD-L1 knockout mice. Based on its\nmechanism of action, fetal exposure to atezolizumab may increase the risk of\ndeveloping immune-mediated disorders or altering the normal immune response.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere is no information regarding the presence of atezolizumab in human milk, the\neffects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. As human IgG is\nexcreted in human milk, the potential for absorption and harm to the infant is unknown.\nBecause of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from\nTECENTRIQ, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 5\nmonths after the last dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating\nTECENTRIQ [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nContraception\nFemales\nBased on its mechanism of action, TECENTRIQ can cause fetal harm when administered\nto a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of\nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TECENTRIQ\nand for at least 5 months following the last dose.\nInfertility\nFemales\nBased on animal studies, TECENTRIQ may impair fertility in females of reproductive\npotential while receiving treatment [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nAlveolar Soft Part Sarcoma\nThe safety and effectiveness of TECENTRIQ for unresectable or metastatic ASPS have\nbeen established in pediatric patients aged 2 years and older. Use of TECENTRIQ for this\nindication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well controlled study of\nTECENTRIQ in adults and 2 adolescent pediatric patients (\u226512 years of age) with ASPS\nwith additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric patients 2 years to <17\nyears. These data suggest that atezolizumab exposure in pediatric patients aged 2 years\nand older is comparable with that of adults and is expected to result in similar safety and\nefficacy to that of adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Pharmacokinetics (12.3), Clinical\nStudies (14.5)]. The course of unresectable or metastatic ASPS is sufficiently similar\nbetween pediatric patients 2 to 11 years old and that of adults and adolescent patients\nto allow extrapolation of efficacy and safety to pediatric patients 2 years and older.\nThe safety and effectiveness of TECENTRIQ for ASPS have not been established in\npediatric patients younger than 2 years of age.\nSolid Tumors and Lymphomas\nThe safety and effectiveness of TECENTRIQ in pediatric patients have not been\nestablished in non-small cell lung cancer, small-cell lung cancer, hepatocellular\ncarcinoma, or melanoma.\nThe safety and effectiveness of TECENTRIQ were assessed, but not established in a\nsingle-arm, multi-center, multi-cohort trial (NCT02541604) in 60 pediatric patients aged 7\nmonths to <17 years with relapsed or progressive solid tumors and lymphomas. No\nnew safety signals were observed in pediatric patients in this study.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 2616 patients with metastatic NSCLC and other tumor types treated with single agent\nTECENTRIQ in clinical studies, 49% were 65 years and over and 15% were 75 years and\nover.\nOf 2421 patients with NSCLC and SCLC treated with TECENTRIQ in combination with\nother antineoplastic drugs in clinical studies, 48% were 65 years and over and 10% were\n75 years and over.\nNo overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients aged\n65 years or older and younger patients.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nAtezolizumab is a programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking antibody.\nAtezolizumab is an Fc-engineered, humanized, non-glycosylated IgG1 kappa\nimmunoglobulin that has a calculated molecular mass of 145 kDa.\nTECENTRIQ (atezolizumab) injection for intravenous use is a sterile, preservative-free,\ncolorless to slightly yellow solution in single-dose vials. Each 20 mL vial contains 1200\nmg of atezolizumab and is formulated in glacial acetic acid (16.5 mg), L-histidine (62 mg),\npolysorbate 20 (8 mg), and sucrose (821.6 mg), with a pH of 5.8. Each 14 mL vial\ncontains 840 mg of atezolizumab and is formulated in glacial acetic acid (11.5 mg), L-\nhistidine (43.4 mg), polysorbate 20 (5.6 mg), and sucrose (575.1 mg) with a pH of 5.8.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nPD L1 may be expressed on tumor cells and/or tumor infiltrating immune cells and can\ncontribute to the inhibition of the anti-tumor immune response in the tumor\nmicroenvironment. Binding of PD L1 to the PD 1 and B7.1 receptors found on T cells\nand antigen presenting cells suppresses cytotoxic T-cell activity, T-cell proliferation and\ncytokine production.\nAtezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD L1 and blocks its interactions\nwith both PD 1 and B7.1 receptors. This releases the PD L1/PD 1 mediated inhibition of\nthe immune response, including activation of the anti-tumor immune response without\ninducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In syngeneic mouse tumor models,\nblocking PD L1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth.\nIn mouse models of cancer, dual inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 and MAPK pathways\nsuppresses tumor growth and improves tumor immunogenicity through increased\nantigen presentation and T cell infiltration and activation compared to targeted therapy\nalone.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nThe exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for\nthe safety and effectiveness of atezolizumab have not been fully characterized.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nAtezolizumab exposure increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 1 mg/kg\nto 20 mg/kg (0.07 to 1.33 times of the approved recommended doses), including a dose\nof 1200 mg administered every 3 weeks. Steady state was achieved after 6 to 9 weeks\nfollowing multiple doses. The systemic accumulation ratio for every 2 weeks\nadministration and every 3 weeks administration is 3.3- and 1.9- fold, respectively.\nDistribution\nThe volume of distribution at steady state is 6.9 L.\nElimination\nThe clearance (CV%) is 0.2 L/day (29%) and the terminal half-life is 27 days.\nAtezolizumab clearance was found to decrease over time, with a mean maximal\nreduction (CV%) from baseline value of 17% (41%); however, the decrease in clearance\nwas not considered clinically relevant.\nSpecific Populations\nThe following factors had no clinically significant effect on the systemic exposure of\natezolizumab: age (2 to 89 years), body weight, sex, albumin levels, tumor burden,\nregion or race, mild or moderate renal impairment [estimated glomerular filtration rate\n(eGFR) 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m ], mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin \u2264 ULN and AST >\nULN or bilirubin > 1 to 1.5 \u00d7 ULN and any AST), moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin\n>1.5 to 3\u00d7 ULN and any AST), level of PD-L1 expression, or performance status.\nPediatric Patients\nAtezolizumab serum concentrations with weight-based dosing at 15 mg/kg up to a\nmaximum of 1200 mg every 3 weeks, in pediatric patients (2 years to <17 years) with\nrelapsed or progressive solid tumors and lymphomas, are comparable to those of adult\npatients receiving 1200 mg every 3 weeks; while the exposure tended to be lower in\npediatric patients less than 12 years old, this is not considered to be clinically relevant.\n12.6 Immunogenicity\nThe observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) is highly dependent on the\nsensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude\nmeaningful comparisons of the incidence of ADA in the studies described below with the\nincidence of ADA in other products.\nDuring the first year of treatment with TECENTRIQ across 8 clinical studies, 13% to 36%\nof patients developed anti-atezolizumab antibodies. Median atezolizumab clearance in\npatients who tested positive for ADA was 19% (minimum 18%, maximum 49%) higher\nas compared to atezolizumab clearance in patients who tested negative for ADA; this\nchange in clearance is not expected to be clinically significant.\nIn OAK and IMbrave150, exploratory analyses showed that the subset of patients who\nwere ADA-positive appeared to have less efficacy (effect on overall survival) as\ncompared to patients who tested negative for ADA [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.3)]. In\nstudy IMpower150, the impact of ADA on efficacy did not appear to be clinically\nsignificant [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In the remaining studies, there is insufficient\ninformation to characterize the effect of ADA on efficacy.\nThe presence of ADA did not have a clinically significant effect on the incidence or\nseverity of adverse reactions.\nAcross clinical studies, 4.3% to 27.5% of neutralizing antibody (NAb)-evaluable patients\nhad a positive NAb status at any timepoint post-treatment. The effect of NAb on\natezolizumab exposure and safety did not appear to be clinically significant. The effect of\nNAb on key efficacy endpoints is uncertain due to small sample sizes.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nNo studies have been performed to test the potential of atezolizumab for carcinogenicity\nor genotoxicity.\nAnimal fertility studies have not been conducted with atezolizumab; however, an\nassessment of the male and female reproductive organs was included in a 26-week,\nrepeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. Weekly administration of\n2\natezolizumab to female monkeys at the highest dose tested caused an irregular\nmenstrual cycle pattern and a lack of newly formed corpora lutea in the ovaries. This\neffect occurred at an estimated AUC approximately 6 times the AUC in patients receiving\nthe recommended dose and was reversible. There was no effect on the male monkey\nreproductive organs.\n13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nIn animal models, inhibition of PD-L1/PD-1 signaling increased the severity of some\ninfections and enhanced inflammatory responses. M. tuberculosis-infected PD-1\nknockout mice exhibit markedly decreased survival compared with wild-type controls,\nwhich correlated with increased bacterial proliferation and inflammatory responses in\nthese animals. PD-L1 and PD-1 knockout mice and mice receiving PD-L1 blocking\nantibody have also shown decreased survival following infection with lymphocytic\nchoriomeningitis virus.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\nAdjuvant Treatment of Stage II-IIIA NSCLC with PD-L1 Expression \u2265 1%\nThe efficacy of TECENTRIQ was evaluated in IMpower010 (NCT02486718), a multi-\ncenter, randomized, open-label trial for the adjuvant treatment of patients with NSCLC\nwho had complete tumor resection and were eligible to receive cisplatin-based adjuvant\nchemotherapy. Eligible patients were required to have Stage IB (tumors \u2265 4 cm) \u2013 Stage\nIIIA NSCLC per the Union for International Cancer Control/American Joint Committee on\nCancer staging system, 7th edition. Patients were excluded if they had a history of\nautoimmune disease; a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia,\ndrug-induced pneumonitis, idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active pneumonitis;\nadministration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to randomization;\nadministration of systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic\nimmunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks prior to randomization.\nA total of 1005 patients who had complete tumor resection and received cisplatin-based\nadjuvant chemotherapy were randomized (1:1) to receive TECENTRIQ 1200 mg\nintravenous infusion every 3 weeks for 16 cycles, unless disease recurrence or\nunacceptable toxicity occurred, or best supportive care (BSC). Randomization was\nstratified by sex, stage of disease, histology, and PD-L1 expression.\nTumor assessments were conducted at baseline of the randomization phase and every\n4 months for the first year following Cycle 1, Day 1 and then every 6 months until year\nfive, then annually thereafter.\nThe median age was 62 years (range: 26 to 84), and 67% of patients were male. The\nmajority of patients were White (73%) and Asian (24%). Most patients were current or\nprevious smokers (78%) and baseline ECOG performance status in patients was 0\n(55%) or 1 (44%). Overall, 12% of patients had Stage IB, 47% had Stage II and 41% had\nStage IIIA disease. PD-L1 expression, defined as the percentage of tumor cells\nexpressing PD-L1 as measured by the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) assay, was \u2265 1% in\n53% of patients, <1% in 44% and unknown in 2.6%.\nThe primary efficacy outcome measure was disease-free survival (DFS) as assessed by\nthe investigator. The primary efficacy analysis population (n = 476) was patients with\nStage II \u2013 IIIA NSCLC with PD-L1 expression on \u2265 1% of tumor cells (PD-L1 \u2265 1% TC).\nDFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of occurrence\nof any of the following: first documented recurrence of disease, new primary NSCLC, or\ndeath due to any cause, whichever occurred first. A key secondary efficacy outcome\nmeasure was overall survival (OS) in the intent-to-treat population.\nAt the time of the interim DFS analysis, the study demonstrated a statistically significant\nimprovement in DFS in the PD-L1 \u2265 1% TC, Stage II \u2013 IIIA patient population.\nEfficacy results are presented in Table 22 and Figure 1.\nTable 22 Efficacy Results from IMpower010 in Patients\nwith Stage II - IIIA NSCLC with PD-L1 expression \u2265 1% TC\nArm A:\nTECENTRIQ\nN = 248\nArm B:\nBest Supportive\nCare\nN = 228\nCI = Confidence interval, NE = Not estimable, NR = Not reached\n*\nDisease-Free\nSurvival\n  Number of events\n(%)\n88 (35)\n105 (46)\n  Median, months\nNR\n35.3\n  (95% CI)\n(36.1, NE)\n(29.0, NE)\n  Hazard ratio  (95%\nCI)\n0.66 (0.50, 0.88)\n  p-value\n0.004\nIn a pre-specified secondary subgroup analysis of patients with PD-L1 TC \u2265 50% Stage\nII \u2013 IIIA NSCLC (n=229), the median DFS was not reached (95% CI: 42.3 months, NE)\nfor patients in the TECENTRIQ arm and was 35.7 months (95% CI: 29.7, NE) for patients\nin the best supportive care arm, with a HR of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.68).

An exploratory analysis of OS in this population resulted\nin a stratified HR of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.51, 1.17).\nMetastatic Chemotherapy-Na\u00efve NSCLC with High PD-L1 Expression\nThe efficacy of TECENTRIQ was evaluated in IMpower110 (NCT02409342), a multicenter,\ninternational, randomized, open-label trial in patients with stage IV NSCLC whose tumors\nexpress PD-L1 (PD-L1 stained \u2265 1% of tumor cells [TC \u2265 1%] or PD-L1 stained tumor-\ninfiltrating immune cells [IC] covering \u2265 1% of the tumor area [IC \u2265 1%]), who had\nreceived no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. PD-L1 tumor status was\ndetermined based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing using the VENTANA PD-L1\n(SP142) Assay. The evaluation of efficacy is based on the subgroup of patients with high\nPD-L1 expression (TC \u2265 50% or IC \u2265 10%), excluding those with EGFR or ALK genomic\ntumor aberrations. The trial excluded patients with a history of autoimmune disease,\nadministration of a live attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to randomization, active\nor untreated CNS metastases, administration of systemic immunostimulatory agents\nwithin 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks prior to\nrandomization.\nRandomization was stratified by sex, ECOG performance status, histology (non-\nsquamous vs. squamous) and PD-L1 expression (TC \u2265 1% and any IC vs. TC < 1% and\nIC \u2265 1%). Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive one of the following treatment\narms:\nArm A: TECENTRIQ 1200 mg every 3 weeks until disease progression or\nunacceptable toxicity\nArm B: Platinum-based chemotherapy\nArm B platinum-based chemotherapy regimens for non-squamous NSCLC consisted of\n2\n2\ncisplatin (75 mg/m ) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m ) OR carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min)\nand pemetrexed (500 mg/m ) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 4 or 6\ncycles followed by pemetrexed (500 mg/m ) until disease progression or unacceptable\ntoxicity.\nArm B platinum-based chemotherapy regimens for squamous NSCLC consisted of\ncisplatin (75 mg/m ) on Day 1 with gemcitabine (1250 mg/m ) on Days 1 and 8 of each\n21-day cycle OR carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min) on Day 1 with gemcitabine (1000\nmg/m ) on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 4 or 6 cycles followed\nby best supportive care until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\nAdministration of TECENTRIQ was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease\nprogression. Tumor assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks\nfollowing Cycle 1, Day 1 and then every 9 weeks thereafter. Tumor specimens were\nevaluated prospectively using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay at a central laboratory\nand the results were used to define subgroups for pre-specified analyses.\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS) sequentially tested in the\nfollowing subgroups of patients, excluding those with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor\naberrations: TC \u226550% or IC \u226510%; TC \u22655% or IC \u22655%; and TC \u22651% or IC \u22651%.\nAmong the 205 chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients with stage IV NSCLC with high PD-L1\nexpression (TC \u2265 50% or IC \u2265 10%) excluding those with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor\naberrations, the median age was 65.0 years (range: 33 to 87), and 70% of patients were\nmale. The majority of patients were White (82%) and Asian (17%). Baseline ECOG\nperformance status was 0 (36%) or 1 (64%); 88% were current or previous smokers;\nand 76% of patients had non-squamous disease while 24% of patients had squamous\ndisease.\nThe trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients with high\nPD-L1 expression (TC \u226550% or IC \u226510%) at the time of the OS interim analysis. There\nwas no statistically significant difference in OS for the other two PD-L1 subgroups (TC\n\u22655% or IC \u22655%; and TC \u22651% or IC \u22651%) at the interim or final analyses.

The investigator-assessed confirmed\nORR was 38% (95% CI: 29%, 48%) in the TECENTRIQ arm and 29% (95% CI: 20%, 39%)\nin the platinum-based chemotherapy arm.\nMetastatic Chemotherapy-Naive Non-Squamous NSCLC\nIMpower150\nThe efficacy of TECENTRIQ with bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin was evaluated\nin IMpower150 (NCT02366143), a multicenter, international, randomized (1:1:1), open-\nlabel trial in patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. Patients with stage IV non-\nsquamous NSCLC who had received no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease but\ncould have received prior EGFR or ALK kinase inhibitor if appropriate, regardless of PD-\nL1 or T-effector gene (tGE) status and ECOG performance status 0 or 1 were eligible.\nThe trial excluded patients with a history of autoimmune disease, administration of a live\nattenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to randomization, active or untreated CNS\nmetastases, administration of systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or\nsystemic immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks prior to randomization, or\nclear tumor infiltration into the thoracic great vessels or clear cavitation of pulmonary\nlesions as seen on imaging. Randomization was stratified by sex, presence of liver\nmetastases, and PD-L1 expression status on tumor cells (TC) and tumor-infiltrating\nimmune cells (IC) as follows: TC3 and any IC vs. TC0/1/2 and IC2/3 vs. TC0/1/2 and\nIC0/1. Patients were randomized to one of the following three treatment arms:\nStratified by sex and ECOG performance status\nBased on the stratified log-rank test compared to Arm A\nCompared to the allocated alpha of 0.0413 (two-sided) for this interim analysis.\n2\n2\nArm A: TECENTRIQ 1200 mg, paclitaxel 175 mg/m  or 200 mg/m  and carboplatin\nAUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 4 or 6 cycles\nArm B: TECENTRIQ 1200 mg, bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, paclitaxel 175 mg/m  or 200\nmg/m , and carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for a\nmaximum of 4 or 6 cycles\nArm C: bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, paclitaxel 175 mg/m  or 200 mg/m , and carboplatin\nAUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 4 or 6 cycles\nPatients who had not experienced disease progression following the completion or\ncessation of platinum-based chemotherapy, received:\nArm A: TECENTRIQ 1200 mg intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until\ndisease progression or unacceptable toxicity\nArm B: TECENTRIQ 1200 mg and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously on Day 1 of\neach 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity\nArm C: bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until\ndisease progression or unacceptable toxicity\nTumor assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks following\nCycle 1, Day 1 and then every 9 weeks thereafter. Tumor specimens were evaluated\nprior to randomization for PD-L1 tumor expression using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142)\nassay at a central laboratory. Tumor tissue was collected at baseline for expression of\ntGE signature and evaluation was performed using a clinical trial assay in a central\nlaboratory prior to the analysis of efficacy outcome measures.\nMajor efficacy outcome measures for comparison of Arms B and C were progression\nfree survival (PFS) by RECIST v1.1 in the tGE-WT (patients with high expression of T-\neffector gene signature [tGE], excluding those with EGFR- and ALK-positive NSCLC\n[WT]) and in the ITT-WT subpopulations and overall survival (OS) in the ITT-WT\nsubpopulation. Additional efficacy outcome measures for comparison of Arms B and C\nor Arms A and C were PFS and OS in the ITT population, OS in the tGE-WT\nsubpopulation, and ORR/DoR in the tGE-WT and ITT-WT subpopulations.\nA total of 1202 patients were enrolled across the three arms of whom 1045 were in the\nITT-WT subpopulation and 447 were in the tGE-WT subpopulation. The demographic\ninformation is limited to the 800 patients enrolled in Arms B and C where efficacy has\nbeen demonstrated. The median age was 63 years (range: 31 to 90), and 60% of\npatients were male. The majority of patients were White (82%), 13% of patients were\nAsian, 10% were Hispanic, and 2% of patients were Black. Clinical sites in Asia (enrolling\n13% of the study population) received paclitaxel at a dose of 175 mg/m  while the\nremaining 87% received paclitaxel at a dose of 200 mg/m . Approximately 14% of\npatients had liver metastases at baseline, and most patients were current or previous\nsmokers (80%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (43%) or 1 (57%). PD-L1 was\nTC3 and any IC in 12%, TC0/1/2 and IC2/3 in 13%, and TC0/1/2 and IC0/1 in 75%. The\ndemographics for the 696 patients in the ITT-WT subpopulation were similar to the ITT\npopulation except for the absence of patients with EGFR- or ALK- positive NSCLC.\nThe trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS between Arms B and\nC in both the tGE-WT and ITT-WT subpopulations, but did not demonstrate a significant\ndifference for either subpopulation between Arms A and C based on the final PFS\nanalyses. In the interim analysis of OS, a statistically significant improvement was\nobserved for Arm B compared to Arm C, but not for Arm A compared to Arm C.\nEfficacy results for the ITT-WT subpopulation are presented in Table 24 and Figure 3.\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nEfficacy results for the ITT-WT subpopulation are presented in Table 24 and Figure 3.\nTable 24: Efficacy Results in ITT-WT Population in IMpower150\nArm C:\nBevacizumab,\nPaclitaxel and\nCarboplatin\nArm B:\nTECENTRIQ\nwith\nBevacizumab,\nPaclitaxel, and\nCarboplatin\nArm A:\nTECENTRIQ\nwith Paclitaxel,\nand Carboplatin\nN = 337\nN = 359\nN = 349\nCI=confidence interval\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\n#\n\u00de\nOverall Survival\n  Deaths (%)\n197 (59%)\n179 (50%)\n179 (51%)\n  Median, months\n14.7\n19.2\n19.4\n  (95% CI)\n(13.3, 16.9)\n(17.0, 23.8)\n(15.7, 21.3)\n  Hazard ratio  (95% CI)\n---\n0.78 (0.64, 0.96) 0.84 (0.72, 1.08)\n  p-value\n---\n0.016\n0.204\nProgression-Free\nSurvival\n  Number of events (%)\n247 (73%)\n247 (69%)\n245 (70%)\n  Median, months\n7.0\n8.5\n6.7\n  (95% CI)\n(6.3, 7.9)\n(7.3, 9.7)\n(5.6, 6.9)\n  Hazard ratio  (95% CI)\n---\n0.71 (0.59, 0.85) 0.94 (0.79, 1.13)\n  p-value\n---\n0.0002\n0.5219\nObjective Response\nRate\n  Number of responders\n(%)\n142 (42%)\n196 (55%)\n150 (43%)\n  (95% CI)\n(37, 48)\n(49, 60)\n(38, 48)\n  Complete Response\n3 (1%)\n14 (4%)\n9 (3%)\n  Partial Response\n139 (41%)\n182 (51%)\n141 (40%)\nDuration of\nResponse\nn = 142\nn = 196\nn = 150\n  Median, months\n6.5\n10.8\n9.5\n  (95% CI)\n(5.6, 7.6)\n(8.4, 13.9)\n(7.0, 13.0)\nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier Curves for Overall Survival in ITT-WT Population in\nIMpower150\nBased on OS interim analysis\nStratified by sex, presence of liver metastases, and PD-L1 expression status on TC and\nIC\nBased on the stratified log-rank test compared to Arm C\nCompared to the allocated \u03b1=0.0174 (two sided) for this interim analysis\nCompared to the allocated \u03b1=0.0128 (two sided) for this interim analysis\nAs determined by independent review facility (IRF) per RECIST v1.1 (Response\nEvaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1)\nCompared to the allocated \u03b1=0.006 (two sided) for the final PFS analysis\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\n#\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00de\n#\n#\nExploratory analyses showed that the subset of patients in the four drug regimen arm\nwho were ADA positive by week 4 (30%) appeared to have similar efficacy (effect on\noverall survival) as compared to patients who tested negative for treatment-emergent\nADA by week 4 (70%) [see, Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)]. In an exploratory analysis,\npropensity score matching was conducted to compare ADA positive patients in the\nTECENTRIQ, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin arm with a matched population in\nthe bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin arm. Similarly ADA negative patients in the\nTECENTRIQ, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin arm were compared with a\nmatched population in the bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin arm. Propensity\nscore matching factors were: baseline sum of longest tumor size (BSLD), baseline\nECOG, baseline albumin, baseline LDH, sex, tobacco history, metastatic site, TC level,\nand IC level. The hazard ratio comparing the ADA-positive subgroup with its matched\ncontrol was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.44, 1.07).

Patients with Stage IV non-squamous\nNSCLC who had received no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease, but could have\nreceived prior EGFR or ALK kinase inhibitor, if appropriate, were eligible. The trial\nexcluded patients with history of autoimmune disease, administration of live attenuated\nvaccine within 28 days prior to randomization, administration of immunostimulatory\nagents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks prior\nto randomization, and active or untreated CNS metastases. Randomization was stratified\nby sex, presence of liver metastases, and PD-L1 tumor expression according to the\nVENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) assay as follows: TC3 and any IC vs. TC0/1/2 and IC2/3 vs.\nTC0/1/2 and IC0/1. Patients were randomized to one of the following treatment\nregimens:\nTECENTRIQ 1200 mg on Day 1, paclitaxel protein-bound 100 mg/m  on Days 1, 8,\nand 15, and carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for a\n2\nmaximum of 4 or 6 cycles followed by TECENTRIQ 1200 mg once every 3 weeks until\ndisease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or\nPaclitaxel protein-bound 100 mg/m  on Days 1, 8 and 15 and carboplatin AUC 6\nmg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 4 or 6 cycles followed\nby best supportive care or pemetrexed.\nTumor assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks, then every 9\nweeks thereafter.

Randomization\nwas stratified by sex, ECOG performance status, and presence of brain metastases.\nPatients were randomized to receive one of the following two treatment arms:\nTECENTRIQ 1200 mg and carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min on Day 1 and etoposide 100\nmg/m  intravenously on Days 1, 2 and 3 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 4\ncycles followed by TECENTRIQ 1200 mg once every 3 weeks until disease\nprogression or unacceptable toxicity, or\nplacebo and carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min on Day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m\nintravenously on Days 1, 2, and 3 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 4 cycles\nfollowed by placebo once every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable\ntoxicity.\nAdministration of TECENTRIQ was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease\nprogression. Tumor assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks\nfollowing Cycle 1, Day 1 and then every 9 weeks thereafter. Patients treated beyond\ndisease progression had tumor assessment conducted every 6 weeks until treatment\ndiscontinuation.\nMajor efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by investigator per\nRECIST v1.1 in the intent-to-treat population. Additional efficacy outcome measures\nincluded ORR and DoR as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1.\nA total of 403 patients were randomized, including 201 to the TECENTRIQ arm and 202\nto the chemotherapy alone arm. The median age was 64 years (range 26 to 90) and\n65% were male. The majority of patients were White (80%); 17% were Asian, 4% were\nHispanic and 1% were Black. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (35%) or 1\n(65%); 9% of patients had a history of brain metastases, and 97% were current or\nprevious smokers.\nEfficacy results are presented in Table 27 and Figure 6.\n2\n2\nTable 27: Efficacy Results from IMpower133\nTECENTRIQ with\nCarboplatin and\nEtoposide\nPlacebo with\nCarboplatin and\nEtoposide\nCI=confidence interval\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\n#\n\u00de\nOverall Survival\nN=201\nN=202\n  Deaths (%)\n104 (52%)\n134 (66%)\n  Median, months\n12.3\n10.3\n  (95% CI)\n(10.8, 15.9)\n(9.3, 11.3)\n  Hazard ratio  (95% CI)\n0.70 (0.54, 0.91)\n  p-value\n0.0069\nProgression-Free\nSurvival\nN=201\nN=202\n  Number of events (%)\n171 (85%)\n189 (94%)\n  Median, months\n5.2\n4.3\n  (95% CI)\n(4.4, 5.6)\n(4.2, 4.5)\n  Hazard ratio  (95% CI)\n0.77 (0.62, 0.96)\n  p-value\n0.0170\nObjective Response\nRate\nN=201\nN=202\n  Number of responders\n(%)\n121 (60%)\n130 (64%)\n  (95% CI)\n(53, 67)\n(57, 71)\n  Complete Response\n(%)\n5 (2%)\n2 (1%)\n  Partial Response (%)\n116 (58%)\n128 (63%)\nDuration of\nResponse\nN=121\nN=130\n  Median, months\n4.2\n3.9\n  (95% CI)\n(4.1, 4.5)\n(3.1, 4.2)\nFigure 6: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Overall Survival in IMpower133\nStratified by sex and ECOG performance status\nBased on the stratified log-rank test\nCompared to the allocated \u03b1 of 0.0193 for this interim analysis based on 78%\ninformation using O'Brien-Fleming boundary\nAs determined by investigator assessment\nper RECIST v1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1)\nCompared to the allocated \u03b1 of 0.05 for this analysis\nConfirmed response\n*\n\u2020, \u2021\n\u00a7,\u00b6\n*\n\u2020, #\n\u00a7,\u00b6,\u00de\n\u00a7,\u00b6,\u00de\n14.3 Hepatocellular Carcinoma\nThe efficacy of TECENTRIQ in combination with bevacizumab was investigated in\nIMbrave150 (NCT03434379), a multicenter, international, open-label, randomized trial in\npatients with locally advanced unresectable and/or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma\nwho have not received prior systemic therapy. Randomization was stratified by\ngeographic region (Asia excluding Japan vs. rest of world), macrovascular invasion\nand/or extrahepatic spread (presence vs. absence), baseline AFP (<400 vs. \u2265400\nng/mL), and by ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1).\nA total of 501 patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either TECENTRIQ as an\nintravenous infusion of 1200 mg, followed by 15 mg/kg bevacizumab, on the same day\nevery 3 weeks or sorafenib 400 mg given orally twice daily, until disease progression or\nunacceptable toxicity. Patients could discontinue either TECENTRIQ or bevacizumab\n(e.g., due to adverse events) and continue on single-agent therapy until disease\nprogression or unacceptable toxicity associated with the single-agent.\nThe study enrolled patients who were ECOG performance score 0 or 1 and who had not\nreceived prior systemic treatment. Patients were required to be evaluated for the\npresence of varices within 6 months prior to treatment, and were excluded if they had\nvariceal bleeding within 6 months prior to treatment, untreated or incompletely treated\nvarices with bleeding, or high risk of bleeding. Patients with Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis,\nmoderate or severe ascites; history of hepatic encephalopathy; a history of autoimmune\ndisease; administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to\nrandomization; administration of systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or\nsystemic immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks prior to randomization; or\nuntreated or corticosteroid-dependent brain metastases were excluded. Tumor\nassessments were performed every 6 weeks for the first 54 weeks and every 9 weeks\nthereafter.\nThe demographics and baseline disease characteristics of the study population were\nbalanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 65 years (range: 26 to 88)\nand 83% of patients were male. The majority of patients were Asian (57%) or White\n(35%); 40% were from Asia (excluding Japan). Approximately 75% of patients presented\nwith macrovascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread and 37% had a baseline AFP\n\u2265400 ng/mL. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (62%) or 1 (38%). HCC risk\nfactors were Hepatitis B in 48% of patients, Hepatitis C in 22%, and 31% of patients had\nnon-viral liver disease. The majority of patients had BCLC stage C (82%) disease at\nbaseline, while 16% had stage B, and 3% had stage A.\nThe major efficacy outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and independent review\nfacility (IRF)-assessed progression free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1. Additional\nefficacy outcome measures were IRF-assessed overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST\nand mRECIST.\nEfficacy results are presented in Table 28 and Figure 7.\nTable 28: Efficacy Results from IMbrave150\nTECENTRIQ in\ncombination with\nBevacizumab\n(N= 336)\nSorafenib\n(N=165)\nOverall Survival\nNumber of deaths (%)\n96 (29)\n65 (39)\nMedian OS in months\n(95% CI)\nNE\n(NE, NE)\n13.2 \n(10.4, NE)\nHazard ratio  (95% CI)\n0.58 (0.42, 0.79)\np-value\n0.0006\nProgression-Free Survival\nNumber of events (%)\n197 (59)\n109 (66)\nMedian PFS in months\n(95% CI)\n6.8 (5.8, 8.3)\n4.3 (4.0, 5.6)\nHazard ratio  (95% CI)\n0.59 (0.47, 0.76)\np-value\n<0.0001\nOverall Response Rate\n(ORR), RECIST 1.1\nNumber of responders\n(%)\n93 (28)\n19 (12)\n(95% CI)\n(23, 33)\n(7,17)\np-value\n<0.0001\nComplete responses, n\n(%)\n22 (7)\n0\nPartial responses, n (%)\n71 (21)\n19 (12)\nDuration of Response\n (DOR) RECIST 1.1\n(n=93)\n(n=19)\nMedian DOR in months\n(95% CI)\nNE\n(NE, NE)\n6.3\n(4.7, NE)\nRange (months)\n(1.3 , 13.4 )\n(1.4 , 9.1 )\nOverall Response Rate\n (ORR), HCC mRECIST\nNumber of responders\n*\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2021\n*\n\u2021,\u00a7\n\u00b6\n\u2021,\u00a7\n#\n#\n#\n#\n\u2021,\u00a7\nCI=confidence interval; HCC mRECIST=Modified RECIST Assessment for\nHepatocellular Carcinoma; NE=not estimable; RECIST 1.1=Response Evaluation\nCriteria in Solid Tumors v1.1\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\n#\nNumber of responders\n(%)\n112 (33)\n21 (13)\n(95% CI)\n(28, 39)\n(8, 19)\np-value\n<0.0001\nComplete responses, n\n(%)\n37 (11)\n3 (1.8)\nPartial responses, n (%)\n75 (22)\n18 (11)\nDuration of Response\n (DOR) HCC mRECIST\n(n=112)\n(n=21)\nMedian DOR in months\n(95% CI)\nNE\n(NE, NE)\n6.3\n(4.9, NE)\nRange (months)\n(1.3 , 13.4 )\n(1.4 , 9.1 )\nFigure 7: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Overall Survival in IMbrave150\nExploratory analyses showed that the subset of patients (20%) who were ADA-positive\nby week 6 appeared to have reduced efficacy (effect on OS) as compared to patients\n(80%) who tested negative for treatment-emergent ADA by week 6 [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.6)]. ADA-positive patients by week 6 appeared to have similar overall\nsurvival compared to sorafenib-treated patients. In an exploratory analysis, inverse\nprobability weighting was conducted to compare ADA-positive patients and ADA-\nnegative patients in the TECENTRIQ and bevacizumab arm to the sorafenib arm. Inverse\nprobability weighting factors were: baseline sum of longest tumor size (BSLD), baseline\nStratified by geographic region (Asia excluding Japan vs. rest of world), macrovascular\ninvasion and/or extrahepatic spread (presence vs. absence), and baseline AFP (<400\nvs. \u2265400 ng/mL)\nBased on two-sided stratified log-rank test; as compared to significance level 0.004 (2-\nsided) based on 161/312=52% information using the OBF method\nPer independent radiology review\nConfirmed responses\nBased on two-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haesnszel test\nDenotes a censored value\n\u00b6\n\u2021,\u00a7\n#\n#\n#\n#\nECOG, baseline albumin, baseline LDH, sex, age, race, geographic region, weight,\nneutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, AFP (<400 ng/mL vs \u2265400 ng/mL), number of\nmetastatic sites, MVI and/or EHS present at study entry, etiology (HBV vs. HCV vs. non-\nviral) and Child-Pugh Score (A5 vs. A6). The OS hazard ratio comparing the ADA-positive\nsubgroup of the TECENTRIQ and bevacizumab arm to sorafenib was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.57,\n1.53). The OS hazard ratio comparing the ADA-negative subgroup to sorafenib was 0.39\n(95% CI: 0.26, 0.60).\n14.4 Melanoma\nThe efficacy of TECENTRIQ in combination with cobimetinib and vemurafenib was\nevaluated in a double-blind, randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled, multicenter trial\n(IMspire150; NCT02908672) conducted in 514 patients. Randomization was stratified by\ngeographic location (North America vs. Europe vs. Australia, New Zealand, and others)\nand baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [less than or equal to upper limit of normal\n(ULN) vs. greater than ULN]. Eligible patients were required to have previously untreated\nunresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma as detected by a\nlocally available test and centrally confirmed with the FoundationOne\u2122 assay. Patients\nwere excluded if they had history of autoimmune disease; administration of a live,\nattenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to randomization; administration of systemic\nimmunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medications\nwithin 2 weeks prior to randomization; and active or untreated CNS metastases.\nTECENTRIQ was initiated after patients received a 28-day treatment cycle of cobimetinib\n60 mg orally once daily (21 days on / 7 days off) and vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice\ndaily Days 1-21 and 720 mg orally twice daily Days 22-28. Patients received TECENTRIQ\n840 mg intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks in combination with\ncobimetinib 60 mg orally once daily and vemurafenib 720 mg orally twice daily, or\nplacebo in combination with cobimetinib 60 mg orally once daily and vemurafenib 960\nmg orally twice daily. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable\ntoxicity. There was no crossover at the time of disease progression. Tumor\nassessments were performed every 8 weeks (\u00b1 1 week) for the first 24 months and\nevery 12 weeks (\u00b1 1 week) thereafter.\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed progression-free\nsurvival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1. Additional efficacy outcomes included PFS assessed by\nan independent central review, investigator-assessed ORR, OS, and DOR.\nThe median age of the study population was 54 years (range: 22-88), 58% of patients\nwere male, 95% were White, a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 (77%) or 1\n(23%), 33% had elevated LDH, 94% had metastatic disease, 60% were Stage IV (M1C),\n56% had less than three metastatic sites at baseline, 3% had prior treatment for brain\nmetastases, 30% had liver metastases at baseline, and 14% had received prior adjuvant\nsystemic therapy. Based on central testing, 74% were identified as having a V600E\nmutation, 11% as having V600K mutation, and 1% as having V600D or V600R\nmutations.\nEfficacy results are summarized in Table 29 and Figure 8.

Eligible patients were required to have histologically or\ncytologically confirmed ASPS that was not curable by surgery, and an ECOG\nperformance status of \u2264 2.\nPatients were excluded if they had known primary central nervous system (CNS)\nmalignancy or symptomatic CNS metastases, known clinically significant liver disease, or\nhistory of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, or evidence\nof active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan.\nAdult patients received 1200 mg intravenously and pediatric patients received 15 mg/kg\n(up to a maximum of 1200 mg) intravenously once every 21 days until disease\nprogression or unacceptable toxicity.\nThe major efficacy outcomes were Overall Response Rate (ORR) and Duration of\nResponse (DOR) by Independent Review Committee according to Response Evaluation\nCriteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.\nA total of 49 patients were enrolled. The median age of patients was 31 years (range:\n12-70); 2% of adult patients (n=47) were \u226565 years of age and the pediatric patients\n(n=2) were \u226512 years of age; 51% of patients were female, 55% White, 29% Black or\nAfrican American, 10% Asian; 53% had an ECOG performance status of 0 and 45% had\nan ECOG performance status of 1. All patients had prior surgery for ASPS and 55%\nreceived at least one prior line of treatment for ASPS; 55% received radiotherapy and\n53% received chemotherapy.

TECENTRIQ can cause your immune system to attack normal organs and\ntissues in any area of your body and can affect the way they work. These problems can\nsometimes become severe or life-threatening and can lead to death. You can have more\nthan one of these problems at the same time. These problems may happen anytime\nduring your treatment or even after your treatment has ended.\nCall or see your healthcare provider right away if you develop any new or\nworse signs or symptoms, including: Lung problems.\ncough\nshortness of breath\nchest pain\nIntestinal problems.\ndiarrhea (loose stools) or more frequent bowel movements than usual\nstools that are black, tarry, sticky, or have blood or mucus\nsevere stomach-area (abdomen) pain or tenderness\nLiver problems.\nyellowing of your skin or the\nwhites of your eyes\nsevere nausea or vomiting\npain on the right side of your\nstomach area (abdomen)\ndark urine (tea colored)\nbleeding or bruising more easily than normal\nHormone gland problems.\n\u00a9\n\u00ae\nheadaches that will not go away\nor unusual headaches\neye sensitivity to light\neye problems\nrapid heart beat\nincreased sweating\nextreme tiredness\nweight gain or weight loss\nfeeling more hungry or thirsty\nthan usual\nurinating more often than usual\nhair loss\nfeeling cold\nconstipation\nyour voice gets deeper\ndizziness or fainting\nchanges in mood or behavior, such as\ndecreased sex drive, irritability, or forgetfulness\nKidney problems.\ndecrease in your amount of urine\nblood in your urine\nswelling of your ankles\nloss of appetite\nSkin problems.\nrash\nitching\nskin blistering or peeling\npainful sores or ulcers in mouth or nose, throat,\nor genital area\nfever or flu-like symptoms\nswollen lymph nodes\nProblems can also happen in other organs.\nThese are not all of the signs and symptoms of immune system problems\nthat can happen with TECENTRIQ. Call or see your healthcare provider right\naway for any new or worse signs or symptoms, including:\nchest pain, irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, or swelling of ankles\nconfusion, sleepiness, memory problems, changes in mood or behavior, stiff neck,\nbalance problems, tingling or numbness of the arms or legs\ndouble vision, blurry vision, sensitivity to light, eye pain, changes in eye sight\npersistent or severe muscle pain or weakness, muscle cramps\nlow red blood cells, bruising\nInfusion reactions that can sometimes be severe or life-threatening. Signs\nand symptoms of infusion reactions may include:\nchills or shaking\nitching or rash\nflushing\nshortness of breath or wheezing\ndizziness\nfeeling like passing out\nfever\nback or neck pain\nComplications, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), in people who\nhave received a bone marrow (stem cell) transplant that uses donor stem\ncells (allogeneic). These complications can be serious and can lead to death. These\ncomplications may happen if you underwent transplantation either before or after being\ntreated with TECENTRIQ. Your healthcare provider will monitor you for these\ncomplications.\nGetting medical treatment right away may help keep these problems from\nbecoming more serious. \nYour healthcare provider will check you for these problems during your treatment with\nTECENTRIQ.

Use appropriate\naseptic technique.\nENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable\nspecial handling and disposal procedures.\nReconstitution\nReconstitute immediately before dilution.\nMore than one vial may be needed for a full dose. Calculate the dose (mg), the total\nvolume of reconstituted ENHERTU solution required, and the number of vial(s) of\nENHERTU needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].\nReconstitute each 100 mg vial by using a sterile syringe to slowly inject 5 mL of Sterile\nWater for Injection, USP into each vial to obtain a final concentration of 20 mg/mL.\nSwirl the vial gently until completely dissolved. Do not shake.\nIf not used immediately, store the reconstituted ENHERTU vials in a refrigerator at\n2\u00baC to 8\u00baC (36\u00baF to 46\u00baF) for up to 24 hours from the time of reconstitution, protect\nthe vial from light. Do not freeze.\nThe product does not contain a preservative. Discard unused ENHERTU after 24\nhours refrigerated.\nDilution\nWithdraw the calculated amount from the vial(s) using a sterile syringe. Parenteral\ndrug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration\nprior to administration whenever solution and container permit. The solution should\nbe clear and colorless to light yellow. Do not use if visible particles are observed or if\nthe solution is cloudy or discolored.\nDilute the calculated volume of reconstituted ENHERTU in an intravenous infusion bag\ncontaining 100 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP. DO NOT use Sodium Chloride\nInjection, USP. ENHERTU is compatible with an infusion bag made of polyvinylchloride\nor polyolefin (copolymer of ethylene and polypropylene).\nGently invert the infusion bag to thoroughly mix the solution. Do not shake.\nCover the infusion bag to protect from light.\nDiscard any unused portion left in the vials.\nAdministration\nIf not used immediately, store the diluted ENHERTU in a refrigerator at 2\u00baC to 8\u00baC\n(36\u00baF to 46\u00baF) for up to 24 hours or at room temperature between 20\u00baC to 25\u00baC\n(68\u00baF to 77 \u00baF) for up to 4 hours including preparation and infusion time.\nProtect from light. Do not freeze.\nThe maximum time from reconstitution of the vial through the end of administration\nshould not exceed 24 hours.\nIf the prepared infusion solution was stored refrigerated (2\u00baC to 8\u00baC [36\u00baF to 46\u00baF]),\nallow the solution to reach room temperature prior to administration. Cover the\n1\ninfusion bag to protect from light.\nAdminister ENHERTU as an intravenous infusion only with an infusion set made of\npolyolefin or polybutadiene.\nAdminister ENHERTU with a 0.20 or 0.22 micron in-line polyethersulfone (PES) or\npolysulfone (PS) filter.\nDo NOT administer as an intravenous push or bolus.\nCover the infusion bag to protect from light during administration.\nDo not mix ENHERTU with other drugs or administer other drugs through the same\nintravenous line.\nFirst infusion: Administer infusion over 90 minutes.\nSubsequent infusions: Administer over 30 minutes if prior infusions were well\ntolerated.\n3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nFor injection: 100 mg of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki as a white to yellowish white\nlyophilized powder in a single-dose vial for reconstitution and further dilution\n4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nNone.\n5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n5.1 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis\nSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can\noccur in patients treated with ENHERTU [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. A higher\nincidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with\nmoderate renal impairment.\nAdvise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or\nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD.\nPromptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by\nradiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic\n(Grade 1) ILD, consider corticosteroid treatment (e.g., \u22650.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or\nequivalent). Withhold ENHERTU until recovery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. In\ncases of symptomatic ILD (Grade 2 or greater), promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid\ntreatment (e.g., \u22651 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14\ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU\nin patients who are diagnosed with symptomatic (Grade 2 or greater) ILD [see Dosage\nand Administration (2.3)].\nHER2-Positive or HER2-Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2-Mutant NSCLC, and Solid\nTumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)\nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2-mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors\ntreated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first\nonset was 5.5 months (range: 0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or\npneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated with ENHERTU.\nHER2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)\nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ\nadenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients.\nMedian time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2 to 21).\n5.2 Neutropenia\nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with\nENHERTU.\nMonitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose,\nand as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require\ndose interruption or reduction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\nHER2-Positive or HER2-Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2-Mutant NSCLC, and Solid\nTumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)\nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2-mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors\ntreated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 63%\nof patients. Seventeen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median\ntime to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 2 to 939). Febrile\nneutropenia was reported in 1% of patients.\nHER2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)\nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ\nadenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was\nreported in 72% of patients. Fifty-one percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil\ncount. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4\nto 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.\n5.3 Left Ventricular Dysfunction\nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular\ndysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with\nanti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU.\nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as\nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently\ndiscontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of less than 40% or absolute decrease from baseline of\ngreater than 20% is confirmed. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with\nsymptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\nTreatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically\nsignificant cardiac disease or LVEF less than 50% prior to initiation of treatment.\nHER2-Positive or HER2-Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2-Mutant NSCLC, and Solid\nTumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)\nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2-mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors\ntreated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 3.8% of patients, of\nwhich 0.6% were Grade 3.\nHER2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)\nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ\nadenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart\nfailure were reported; however, on echocardiography, 8% were found to have\nasymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.\n5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on its mechanism of action, ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to\na pregnant woman. In postmarketing reports, use of a HER2-directed antibody during\npregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios manifesting as fatal pulmonary\nhypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Based on its mechanism of\naction, the topoisomerase inhibitor component of ENHERTU, DXd, can also cause\nembryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman because it is genotoxic and\ntargets actively dividing cells [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology\n(12.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus.\nVerify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of\nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during\ntreatment and for 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with\nfemale partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during\ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the\nlabeling:\nInterstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nNeutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nHER2-Positive and HER2-Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2-Mutant NSCLC, and Solid\nTumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)\nThe pooled safety population described in WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS reflects\nexposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in 1799 patients in Study\nDS8201-A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY-Breast01, DESTINY-Breast02, DESTINY-\nBreast03, DESTINY-Breast04, DESTINY-Lung01, DESTINY-Lung02, DESTINY-CRC02, and\nDESTINY-PanTumor02. Among these patients, 65% were exposed for greater than 6\nmonths and 38% were exposed for greater than 12 months. In this pooled safety\npopulation, the most common (\u226520%) adverse reactions (including laboratory\nabnormalities) were nausea (73%), decreased white blood cell count (70%), decreased\nhemoglobin (66%), decreased neutrophil count (63%), decreased lymphocyte count\n(58%), fatigue (56%), decreased platelet count (48%), increased aspartate\naminotransferase (47%), increased alanine aminotransferase (43%), vomiting (40%),\nincreased blood alkaline phosphatase (38%), alopecia (34%), constipation (33%),\ndecreased appetite (32%), decreased blood potassium (31%), diarrhea (29%),\nmusculoskeletal pain (24%), and abdominal pain (20%).\nHER2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)\nThe data described in WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to ENHERTU 6.4\nmg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in 125 patients in DESTINY-Gastric01.\nHER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer\nDESTINY-Breast03\nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 257 patients with unresectable or metastatic\nHER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in\nDESTINY-Breast03 [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. ENHERTU was administered by\nintravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 14\nmonths (range: 0.7 to 30) for patients who received ENHERTU and 7 months (range:\n0.7 to 25) for patients who received ado-trastuzumab emtansine.\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 19% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious\nadverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were vomiting, interstitial\nlung disease, pneumonia, pyrexia, and urinary tract infection. Fatalities due to adverse\nreactions occurred in 0.8% of patients including COVID-19 and sudden death (one\npatient each).\nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 14% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis\naccounted for 8%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 44% of\npatients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated\nwith dose interruption were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia,\npneumonia, nausea, fatigue, and ILD/pneumonitis. Dose reductions occurred in 21% of\npatients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated\nwith dose reduction were nausea, neutropenia, and fatigue.\nThe most common (\u226520%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were\nnausea, decreased white blood cell count, decreased neutrophil count, increased\naspartate aminotransferase, decreased hemoglobin, decreased lymphocyte count,\nincreased alanine aminotransferase, decreased platelet count, fatigue, vomiting,\nincreased blood alkaline phosphatase, alopecia, decreased blood potassium,\nconstipation, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, decreased appetite, headache, respiratory\ninfection, abdominal pain, increased blood bilirubin, and stomatitis.\nTables 3 and 4 summarize common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities\nobserved in DESTINY-Breast03.\nTable 3: Common Adverse Reactions (\u226510% All Grades or \u22652%\nGrades 3-4) in Patients Treated with ENHERTU in DESTINY-Breast03\nAdverse Reactions\nENHERTU\n5.4 mg/kg\nN=257\nAdo-trastuzumab\nemtansine\n3.6 mg/kg\nN=261\nAll Grades\n%\nGrades 3-\n4\n%\nAll Grades\n%\nGrades 3-\n4\n%\nEvents were graded using NCI CTCAE version 5.0.\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\n#\n\u00de\n\u00df\n\u00e0\n\u00e8\nGastrointestinal Disorders\n  Nausea\n76\n7\n30\n0.4\n  Vomiting\n49\n1.6\n10\n0.8\n  Constipation\n34\n0\n20\n0\n  Diarrhea\n29\n1.2\n7\n0.4\n  Abdominal pain\n21\n0.8\n8\n0.4\n  Stomatitis\n20\n0.8\n5\n0\n  Dyspepsia\n11\n0\n6\n0\nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions\n  Fatigue\n49\n6\n35\n0.8\nBlood and Lymphatic System Disorders\n  Anemia\n33\n7\n17\n6\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders\n  Alopecia\n37\n0.4\n3.1\n0\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders\n  Musculoskeletal pain\n31\n1.2\n25\n0.4\nMetabolism and Nutrition Disorders\n  Decreased appetite\n29\n1.6\n17\n0.4\nInvestigations\n  Decreased weight\n17\n1.2\n6\n0.4\nRespiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders\n  Respiratory infection\n22\n0.8\n12\n1.1\n  Epistaxis\n11\n0\n16\n0.4\n  Cough\n11\n0.4\n10\n0\n  Interstitial lung disease\n11\n0.8\n1.9\n0\nNervous System Disorders\n  Headache\n22\n0.4\n16\n0\n  Peripheral neuropathy\n13\n0.4\n14\n0.4\n  Dizziness\n13\n0.4\n8\n0\nIncluding abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, lower abdominal pain, and upper\nabdominal pain\nIncluding stomatitis, aphthous ulcer, mouth ulceration, oral mucosa erosion, and oral\nmucosal eruption\nIncluding fatigue, asthenia, malaise, and lethargy\nIncluding anemia, decreased hemoglobin, and decreased red blood cell count\nThis Grade 3 event was reported by the investigator.

There are no available data on the use of ENHERTU in pregnant\nwomen. In postmarketing reports, use of a HER2-directed antibody during pregnancy\nresulted in cases of oligohydramnios manifesting as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal\nabnormalities, and neonatal death (see Data). Based on its mechanism of action, the\ntopoisomerase inhibitor component of ENHERTU, DXd, can also cause embryo-fetal\n*\nPercentages were calculated using the number of patients with worsening\nlaboratory values from baseline and the number of patients with both baseline and\npost-treatment measurements as the denominator.\nharm when administered to a pregnant woman because it is genotoxic and targets\nactively dividing cells [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\nAdvise patients of the potential risks to a fetus.\nThere are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient\nbecomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU (see Clinical\nConsiderations).\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated\npopulation is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or\nother adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk\nof major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and\n15 to 20%, respectively.\nClinical Considerations\nFetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\nMonitor women who received ENHERTU during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to\nconception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal testing that is\nappropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care.\nData\nHuman Data\nThere are no available data on the use of ENHERTU in pregnant women. In\npostmarketing reports in pregnant women receiving a HER2-directed antibody, cases of\noligohydramnios manifesting as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and\nneonatal death have been reported. These case reports described oligohydramnios in\npregnant women who received a HER2-directed antibody either alone or in combination\nwith chemotherapy. In some case reports, amniotic fluid index increased after use of a\nHER2-directed antibody was stopped.\nAnimal Data\nThere were no animal reproductive or developmental toxicity studies conducted with\nfam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere is no data regarding the presence of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in human\nmilk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of\nthe potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to\nbreastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of\nENHERTU.\nContraception\nFemales\nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective\ncontraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose.\nMales\nBecause of the potential for genotoxicity, advise male patients with female partners of\nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU\nand for 4 months after the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\nInfertility\nBased on findings in animal toxicity studies, ENHERTU may impair male reproductive\nfunction and fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nSafety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the 1287 patients with HER2-positive or HER2-low breast cancer treated with\nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 22% were 65 years or older and 3.8% were 75 years or older. No\noverall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients \u226565\nyears of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4\nadverse reactions observed in patients aged 65 years or older (59%) as compared to\nyounger patients (49%).\nOf the 101 patients with HER2-mutant unresectable or metastatic NSCLC treated with\nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were 65 years or older and 8% were 75 years or older.

No overall differences in efficacy or\nsafety were observed between patients \u226565 years of age compared to younger\npatients.\nOf the 192 patients with HER2-positive (IHC 3+) unresectable or metastatic solid tumors\ntreated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-PanTumor02, DESTINY-Lung01 or\nDESTINY-CRC02, 39% were 65 years or older and 9% were 75 years or older. No overall\ndifferences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients \u226565 years of age\ncompared to younger patients.\n8.6 Renal Impairment\nNo dose adjustment of ENHERTU is required in patients with mild (creatinine clearance\n[CLcr] \u226560 and <90 mL/min) or moderate (CLcr \u226530 and <60 mL/min) renal impairment\n[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis\nhas been observed in patients with moderate renal impairment [see Warnings and\nPrecautions (5.1)]. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently.\nThe recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with\nsevere renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n,\n8.7 Hepatic Impairment\nNo dose adjustment of ENHERTU is required in patients with mild (total bilirubin \u2264ULN\nand any AST >ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) or moderate\n(total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. In patients with\nmoderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for\nincreased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3)]. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established\nfor patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST)\n[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n11 DESCRIPTION\nFam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase\ninhibitor conjugate. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is an antibody-drug conjugate\n(ADC) composed of three components: 1) a humanized anti-HER2 IgG1 monoclonal\nantibody (mAb), covalently linked to 2) a topoisomerase inhibitor, via 3) a tetrapeptide-\nbased cleavable linker. Deruxtecan is composed of a protease-cleavable maleimide\ntetrapeptide linker and the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd, which is an exatecan derivative.\nThe antibody is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA\ntechnology, and the topoisomerase inhibitor and linker are produced by chemical\nsynthesis. Approximately 8 molecules of deruxtecan are attached to each antibody\nmolecule. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki has the following structure:\nENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) is a sterile, white to yellowish white,\npreservative-free lyophilized powder in single-dose vials. Each vial delivers 100 mg of\nfam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, L-histidine (4.45 mg), L-histidine hydrochloride\nmonohydrate (20.2 mg), polysorbate 80 (1.5 mg), and sucrose (450 mg). Following\nreconstitution with 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the resulting concentration\nof fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is 20 mg/mL with a pH of 5.5. The resulting\nsolution is administered by intravenous infusion following dilution.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nFam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is a HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate. The\nantibody is a humanized anti-HER2 IgG1. The small molecule, DXd, is a topoisomerase I\ninhibitor attached to the antibody by a cleavable linker. Following binding to HER2 on\ntumor cells, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki undergoes internalization and\nintracellular linker cleavage by lysosomal enzymes. Upon release, the membrane-\npermeable DXd causes DNA damage and apoptotic cell death.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nExposure-Response Relationships\nExposure relationship for efficacy has not been fully characterized. Higher systemic\nexposure to fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was associated with a higher incidence\nrate of any grade ILD.\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nThe administration of multiple doses of ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks did not show\na large mean effect (i.e., >20 ms) on the QTc interval in an open-label, single-arm study\nin 51 patients with metastatic HER2-positive cancer.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was evaluated in patients\nwith cancer. Following a single dose, exposures (C\n and AUC) of fam-trastuzumab\nderuxtecan-nxki and released topoisomerase inhibitor (DXd) increased proportionally\nover a dose range of 3.2 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg (approximately 0.6 to 1.5 times the\nrecommended dose in breast cancer, NSCLC, and HER2-positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors\nand 0.5 to 1.25 times the recommended dose in gastric cancer).\nAt the recommended dosage of ENHERTU for patients with metastatic breast cancer,\nNSCLC, and HER2-positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors, the geometric mean (coefficient of\nvariation [CV]%) C\n of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and DXd were 132 \u00b5g/mL\n(20%) and 4.7 ng/mL (48%), respectively, and the AUC of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-\nnxki and DXd were 772 \u00b5g\u2219day/mL (27%) and 29 ng\u2219day/mL (48%), respectively.\nAccumulation of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was approximately 35% at steady-\nstate (Cycle 3).\nAt the recommended dosage of ENHERTU for patients with HER2-positive gastric\ncancer, the geometric mean C\n of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and DXd were\n126 \u00b5g/mL (18%) and 5.2 ng/mL (42%), respectively, and the AUC\nof fam-trastuzumab\nderuxtecan-nxki and DXd were 743 \u00b5g\u2219day/mL (26%) and 33 ng\u2219day/mL (43%),\nrespectively. Accumulation of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was approximately\n39% at steady-state (Cycle 3).\nDistribution\nThe estimated volume of distribution of the central compartment (V ) of fam-\ntrastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was 2.68 L.\nDXd plasma protein binding is approximately 97% and the blood-to-plasma ratio is\napproximately 0.6, in vitro.\nElimination\nThe median elimination half-life (t\n) of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is 5.4-5.7\nmax\nmax\nmax,ss\nss \nc\n1/2\ndays. The estimated systemic clearance of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was 0.41\nL/day.\nThe median elimination half-life (t\n) of DXd is 5.4-6.1 days. The estimated systemic\nclearance of DXd was 18.3 L/h.\nMetabolism\nThe humanized HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody is expected to be degraded into small\npeptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous\nIgG.\nIn vitro, DXd is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4.\nSpecific Populations\nNo clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of fam-trastuzumab\nderuxtecan-nxki or DXd were observed for age (20-96 years); race (Asian vs Non-\nAsian), including White, and Black or African American; sex; body weight (27.3-125.4\nkg); tumor types; mild hepatic impairment; mild or moderate renal impairment.\nThe pharmacokinetics of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki or DXd in patients with\nmoderate to severe hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment is unknown.\nDrug Interaction Studies\nClinical Studies\nEffect of CYP3A Inhibitors on DXd: Coadministration of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A\ninhibitor, with multiple doses of ENHERTU increased steady state AUC\n of fam-\ntrastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki by 11% and DXd by 18%. The impact of these changes is\nnot clinically meaningful.\nEffect of OATP Inhibitors on DXd: Coadministration of ritonavir, a dual inhibitor of\nOATP1B/CYP3A, with multiple doses of ENHERTU increased steady state AUC\nof\nfam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki by 19% and DXd by 22%. The impact of these\nchanges is not clinically meaningful.\nIn Vitro Studies\nEffects of DXd on CYP Enzymes: DXd does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8,\nCYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A nor induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A.\nEffects of DXd on Transporters: At clinically relevant concentrations (steady-state C\nof ~0.2 \u03bcmol/L), DXd has a low potential to inhibit OAT1 (IC\n value of 12.7 \u03bcmol/L),\nOAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1 (IC\n value of 14.4 \u03bcmol/L), OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2-K,\nP-gp, BCRP, or BSEP transporters.\nEffects of Other Drugs on DXd: DXd is a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE2-K, P-\ngp, MRP1, and BCRP.\n12.6 Immunogenicity\nThe observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) is highly dependent on the\nsensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude\nmeaningful comparisons of the incidence of ADA in the studies described below with the\nincidence of ADA in other studies, including those of ENHERTU or of other anti-HER2\nproducts.\n1/2\n1/2\n0-17 days\n0-17 days \nmax\n50\n50\nAmong patients who received ENHERTU as a single agent and were tested for ADA over\na 6 to 9-month treatment period in 12 clinical trials, anti-fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-\nnxki antibodies developed in 1.5% (27/1798) of patients who received ENHERTU 5.4\nmg/kg every three weeks and in 2.6% (21/793) of patients who received ENHERTU 6.4\nmg/kg every three weeks. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-drug\nantibodies on pharmacokinetics, safety, or effectiveness of fam-trastuzumab\nderuxtecan-nxki.\nThe incidence of neutralizing antibodies against fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was\n0.06% and 0% for the respective dosages. Due to the limited number of patients who\ndeveloped neutralizing antibodies against fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, the effect\nof neutralizing antibodies is unknown.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-\nnxki.\nThe topoisomerase inhibitor component of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, DXd, was\nclastogenic in both an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay and an in vitro\nChinese hamster lung chromosome aberration assay and was not mutagenic in an in\nvitro bacterial reverse mutation assay.\nFertility studies have not been conducted with fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki. In a\nsix-week repeat-dose toxicity study in rats, intravenous administration of fam-\ntrastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki resulted in spermatid retention at 20 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg\n(approximately 4 and 9 times the human recommended dose of 5.4 mg/kg based on\nAUC, respectively). Decreased testes and epididymides weights, tubular\natrophy/degeneration in testes, and reduced sperm count in epididymides were\nobserved at a dose of 197 mg/kg (19 times the human recommended dose of 5.4\nmg/kg based on AUC). In a three-month repeat-dose toxicity study in monkeys,\nintravenous administration of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki resulted in decreased\nnumbers of round spermatids in the testes at seminiferous tubule stages V to VI at \u226530\nmg/kg (\u22657 times the human recommended dose of 5.4 mg/kg based on AUC). Evidence\nof reversibility was observed in monkeys by the end of a three-month recovery period.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer\nDESTINY-Breast03\nThe efficacy of ENHERTU was evaluated in study DESTINY-Breast03 (NCT03529110), a\nmulticenter, open-label, randomized trial that enrolled 524 patients with HER2-positive,\nunresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer who received prior trastuzumab and\ntaxane therapy for metastatic disease or developed disease recurrence during or within\n6 months of completing adjuvant therapy. HER2 expression was based on archival\ntissue tested at a central laboratory prior to enrollment with HER2 positivity defined as\nHER2 IHC 3+ or ISH positive. Patients were excluded for a history of ILD/pneumonitis\nrequiring treatment with steroids, ILD/pneumonitis at screening, or clinically significant\ncardiac disease. Patients were also excluded for untreated and symptomatic brain\nmetastases, ECOG performance status >1, or prior treatment with an anti-HER2\nantibody-drug conjugate in the metastatic setting.\nPatients were randomized 1:1 to receive either ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg (N=261) or ado-\ntrastuzumab emtansine 3.6 mg/kg (N=263) by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until\nunacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Randomization was stratified by hormone\nreceptor status, prior treatment with pertuzumab, and visceral versus non-visceral\ndisease. Tumor imaging was obtained every 6 weeks and CT/MRI of the brain was\nmandatory for all patients at baseline. The major efficacy outcomes were progression-\nfree survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) based on\nResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 and overall survival (OS).\nConfirmed objective response rate (ORR) was an additional outcome measure.\nThe median age was 54 years (range: 20-83); 80% were <65 years; 99.6% were female;\n60% were Asian, 27% were White, and 3.6% were Black; 11% of patients were of\nHispanic/Latino ethnicity. Patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 (63%) or 1\n(37%) at baseline. Seventy-three percent had visceral disease, 16% had brain\nmetastases at baseline, 52% were hormone receptor positive (HR+), and 48% of\npatients had received one line of prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting.

HER2-low expression was defined as IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-, as determined at\na central laboratory using Ventana's PATHWAY anti-HER-2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal\nPrimary Antibody assay. Patients must have received chemotherapy in the metastatic\nsetting or have developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing\nadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients who were HR+ must have received at least one\nendocrine therapy or be ineligible for endocrine therapy. Patients were randomized 2:1\nto receive either ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg (N=373) by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks or\nphysician's choice of chemotherapy (N=184, eribulin, capecitabine, gemcitabine, nab\npaclitaxel, or paclitaxel). Randomization was stratified by HER2 IHC status of tumor\nsamples (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-), number of prior lines of chemotherapy in the\nmetastatic setting (1 or 2), and HR status/prior CDK4/6i treatment (HR+ with prior\nCDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, HR+ without prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, or HR-).\nTreatment was administered until disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or\nunacceptable toxicity. The study excluded patients with a history of ILD/pneumonitis\nrequiring treatment with steroids or ILD/pneumonitis at screening and clinically\nsignificant cardiac disease. Patients were also excluded for untreated or symptomatic\nbrain metastases or ECOG performance status >1.\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was PFS in patients with HR+ breast cancer\nassessed by BICR based on RECIST v1.1.

Patients were prospectively selected for treatment\nwith ENHERTU based on the presence of activating HER2 (ERBB2) mutations by local\ntesting using tissue. Samples from DESTINY-Lung01 were retrospectively tested using\nOncomine  Dx Target Test (Life Technologies Corporation, Tissue-test) and\nGuardant360\n CDx test (Guardant Health Inc., Plasma test). Demographic and baseline\ndisease characteristics were similar for patients in DESTINY-Lung01 and DESTINY-\nLung02, except for race (34% Asian vs 79% Asian, respectively). Response rates were\nconsistent across dose levels. Increased rates of ILD/pneumonitis were observed at the\nhigher dose. The approved recommended dose of 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3\nweeks in the DESTINY-Lung02 study is described below [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nThe efficacy of ENHERTU was evaluated in DESTINY-Lung02, a multicenter, multicohort,\nrandomized, blinded, dose-optimization trial. Eligible patients were required to have\nunresectable or metastatic HER2-mutant non-squamous NSCLC with disease\nprogression after one prior systemic therapy.

The median time to first onset for increased AST was 6 weeks\n(range: 1 day to 3.4 years) and increased ALT was 5.8 weeks (range: 1 day to 2.5\nyears).\nMonitor ALT and AST prior to initiating RETEVMO, every 2 weeks during the first 3\nmonths, then monthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose or\npermanently discontinue RETEVMO based on the severity [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.5)].\n5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis\nSevere, life-threatening, and fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis can occur in\npatients treated with RETEVMO. ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 1.8% of patients who\nreceived RETEVMO, including 0.3% with Grade 3 or 4 events, and 0.3% with fatal\nreactions.\nMonitor for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Withhold RETEVMO and\npromptly investigate for ILD in any patient who presents with acute or worsening of\nrespiratory symptoms which may be indicative of ILD (e.g., dyspnea, cough, and fever).\nWithhold, reduce dose or permanently discontinue RETEVMO based on severity of\nconfirmed ILD [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\n5.3 Hypertension\nHypertension occurred in 41% of patients, including Grade 3 hypertension in 20% and\nGrade 4 in one (0.1%) patient [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Overall, 6.3% had their\ndose interrupted and 1.3% had their dose reduced for hypertension. Treatment-\nemergent hypertension was most commonly managed with anti-hypertension\nmedications.\nDo not initiate RETEVMO in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Optimize blood\npressure prior to initiating RETEVMO. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week, at least\nmonthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. Initiate or adjust anti-hypertensive therapy\nas appropriate. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue RETEVMO based on\nthe severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\n5.4 QT Interval Prolongation\nRETEVMO can cause concentration-dependent QT interval prolongation [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.2)]. An increase in QTcF interval to >500 ms was measured in 7% of\npatients and an increase in the QTcF interval of at least 60 ms over baseline was\nmeasured in 20% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. RETEVMO has not been\nstudied in patients with clinically significant active cardiovascular disease or recent\nmyocardial infarction.\nMonitor patients who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation, including\npatients with known long QT syndromes, clinically significant bradyarrhythmias, and\nsevere or uncontrolled heart failure. Assess QT interval, electrolytes and TSH at baseline\nand periodically during treatment, adjusting frequency based upon risk factors including\ndiarrhea. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia prior to initiating\nRETEVMO and during treatment.\nMonitor the QT interval more frequently when RETEVMO is concomitantly administered\nwith strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors or drugs known to prolong QTc interval.\nWithhold and dose reduce or permanently discontinue RETEVMO based on the severity\n[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\n5.5 Hemorrhagic Events\nSerious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with RETEVMO. Grade \u22653\nhemorrhagic events occurred in 3.1% of patients treated with RETEVMO, including 4\n(0.5%) patients with fatal hemorrhagic events, including cerebral hemorrhage (n = 2),\ntracheostomy site hemorrhage (n = 1), and hemoptysis (n=1).\nPermanently discontinue RETEVMO in patients with severe or life-threatening\nhemorrhage [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\n5.6 Hypersensitivity\nHypersensitivity occurred in 6% of patients receiving RETEVMO, including Grade 3\nhypersensitivity in 1.9%. The median time to onset was 1.9 weeks (range: 5 days to 2\nyears). Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity included fever, rash and arthralgias or\nmyalgias with concurrent decreased platelets or transaminitis.\nIf hypersensitivity occurs, withhold RETEVMO and begin corticosteroids at a dose of\n1 mg/kg prednisone (or equivalent). Upon resolution of the event, resume RETEVMO at a\nreduced dose and increase the dose of RETEVMO by 1 dose level each week as tolerated\nuntil reaching the dose taken prior to onset of hypersensitivity [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.5)]. Continue steroids until patient reaches target dose and then taper.\nPermanently discontinue RETEVMO for recurrent hypersensitivity.\n5.7 Tumor Lysis Syndrome\nTumor lysis syndrome (TLS) occurred in 0.6% of patients with medullary thyroid\ncarcinoma receiving RETEVMO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients may be at risk of\nTLS if they have rapidly growing tumors, a high tumor burden, renal dysfunction, or\ndehydration. Closely monitor patients at risk, consider appropriate prophylaxis including\nhydration, and treat as clinically indicated.\n5.8 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing\nImpaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the vascular\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway. Therefore, RETEVMO has the\npotential to adversely affect wound healing.\nWithhold RETEVMO for at least 7 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at\nleast 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of\nresumption of RETEVMO after resolution of wound healing complications has not been\nestablished.\n5.9 Hypothyroidism\nRETEVMO can cause hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 13% of patients\ntreated with RETEVMO; all reactions were Grade 1 or 2. Hypothyroidism occurred in 13%\nof patients (50/373) with thyroid cancer and 13% of patients (53/423) with other solid\ntumors including NSCLC [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nMonitor thyroid function before treatment with RETEVMO and periodically during\ntreatment. Treat with thyroid hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold\nRETEVMO until clinically stable or permanently discontinue RETEVMO based on severity\n[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\n5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on data from animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action, RETEVMO\ncan cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of\nselpercatinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis at maternal exposures that were\napproximately equal to those observed at the recommended human dose of 160 mg\ntwice daily resulted in embryolethality and malformations.\nAdvise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a\nfetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during\ntreatment with RETEVMO and for 1 week after the last dose. Advise males with female\npartners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with\nRETEVMO and for 1 week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].\n5.11 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis/Slipped Upper Femoral Epiphysis in\nPediatric Patients\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis/slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SCFE/SUFE) occurred\nin 1 adolescent (3.7% of 27 patients) receiving RETEVMO in LIBRETTO-121 [see Adverse\nReactions (6.1)]. Monitor patients for symptoms indicative of SCFE/SUFE and treat as\nmedically and surgically appropriate [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the\nlabeling:\nHepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nHypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\nQT Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]\nHemorrhagic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]\nHypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]\nTumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]\nRisk of Impaired Wound Healing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]\nHypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]\nSlipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis/Slipped Upper Femoral Epiphysis in Adolescent\nPatients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nRET Gene Fusion or Gene Mutation Positive Solid Tumors\nLIBRETTO-001\nThe pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS and below\nreflects exposure to RETEVMO as a single agent at 160 mg orally twice daily evaluated in\n796 patients with advanced solid tumors in LIBRETTO-001 [see Clinical Studies (14)].\nAmong the 796 patients who received RETEVMO, 84% were exposed for 6 months or\nlonger and 73% were exposed for greater than one year.

If coadministration cannot be avoided, take RETEVMO with food (with a PPI)\nor modify its administration time (with a H2 receptor antagonist or a locally-acting\n1\n#\n1\n#\nantacid) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\nStrong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors\nConcomitant use of RETEVMO with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor increases\nselpercatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may\nincrease the risk of RETEVMO adverse reactions, including QTc interval prolongation.\nAvoid concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors with RETEVMO. If\nconcomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce\nthe RETEVMO dosage and monitor the QT interval with ECGs more frequently [see\nDosage and Administration (2.6), Warning and Precautions (5.4)].\nStrong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers\nConcomitant use of RETEVMO with a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer decreases\nselpercatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may\nreduce RETEVMO anti-tumor activity.\nAvoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers with RETEVMO.\n7.2 Effects of RETEVMO on Other Drugs\nCYP2C8 and CYP3A Substrates\nRETEVMO is a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor and a weak CYP3A inhibitor. Concomitant use\nof RETEVMO with CYP2C8 and CYP3A substrates increases their plasma concentrations\n[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions\nrelated to these substrates. Avoid coadministration of RETEVMO with CYP2C8 and\nCYP3A substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to increased adverse\nreactions. If coadministration cannot be avoided, follow recommendations for CYP2C8\nand CYP3A substrates provided in their approved product labeling.\nCertain P-gp Substrates\nRETEVMO is a P-gp inhibitor. Concomitant use of RETEVMO with P-gp substrates\nincreases their plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may\nincrease the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates. Avoid\ncoadministration of RETEVMO with P-gp substrates where minimal concentration\nchanges may lead to increased adverse reactions. If coadministration cannot be\navoided, follow recommendations for P-gp substrates provided in their approved\nproduct labeling.\n7.3 Drugs that Prolong QT Interval\nRETEVMO is associated with QTc interval prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions\n(5.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Monitor the QT interval with ECGs more frequently in\npatients who require treatment with concomitant medications known to prolong the QT\ninterval.\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on findings from animal studies, and its mechanism of action [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.1)], RETEVMO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant\nwoman. There are no available data on RETEVMO use in pregnant women to inform\ndrug-associated risk. Administration of selpercatinib to pregnant rats during the period\nof organogenesis resulted in embryolethality and malformations at maternal exposures\nthat were approximately equal to the human exposure at the clinical dose of 160 mg\ntwice daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nSelpercatinib administration to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral\ndoses \u2265100 mg/kg [approximately 3.6 times the human exposure based on the area\nunder the curve (AUC) at the clinical dose of 160 mg twice daily] resulted in 100% post-\nimplantation loss. At the dose of 50 mg/kg [approximately equal to the human exposure\n(AUC) at the clinical dose of 160 mg twice daily], 6 of 8 females had 100% early\nresorptions; the remaining 2 females had high levels of early resorptions with only 3\nviable fetuses across the 2 litters. All viable fetuses had decreased fetal body weight and\nmalformations (2 with short tail and one with small snout and localized edema of the\nneck and thorax).\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of selpercatinib or its metabolites in human milk or on\ntheir effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for\nserious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during\ntreatment with RETEVMO and for 1 week after the last dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nBased on animal data, RETEVMO can cause embryolethality and malformations at doses\nresulting in exposures less than or equal to the human exposure at the clinical dose of\n160 mg twice daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating RETEVMO\n[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nContraception\nFemales\nAdvise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during\ntreatment with RETEVMO and for 1 week after the last dose.\nMales\nAdvise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective\ncontraception during treatment with RETEVMO and for 1 week after the last dose.\nInfertility\nRETEVMO may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.4), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of RETEVMO have been established in pediatric patients 2\nyears of age and older for the treatment of:\nadvanced or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) with a RET mutation who\nrequire systemic therapy\nadvanced or metastatic thyroid cancer with a RET gene fusion who require systemic\ntherapy and are radioactive iodine-refractory (if radioactive iodine is appropriate)\nlocally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a RET gene fusion that have\nprogressed on or following prior systemic treatment or who have no satisfactory\nalternative treatment options.\nUse of RETEVMO for these indications is supported by evidence from adequate and well-\ncontrolled studies in adult and pediatric patients with additional pharmacokinetic and\nsafety data in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older [see Adverse Reactions (6.1),\nClinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3, 14.4)]. The predicted\nexposures of selpercatinib in pediatric patients at the recommended dosages were\nwithin the range of values predicted in patients \u2265 12 years and \u2265 50 kg in body weight\nreceiving the approved recommended dosage of 160 mg twice daily [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.3)].\nThe safety and effectiveness of RETEVMO have not been established in these indications\nin patients less than 2 years of age.\nThe safety and effectiveness of RETEVMO have not been established in pediatric patients\nfor other indications [see Indications and Usage (1)].\nJuvenile Animal Toxicity Data\nIn a juvenile rat toxicity study, animals were dosed daily with selpercatinib from post-\nnatal day 21 to day 70 (approximately equivalent to a human child to late adolescent).\nSelpercatinib increased physeal thickness of multiple bones, extending into the\nmetaphysis and associated with decreased trabecular bone, which was not reversible at\ndoses approximately equivalent to or greater than the adult human exposure at the\nclinical dose of 160 mg twice daily. Growth plate changes were associated with\nimpairment of bone modeling, resulting in decreased femur length and with reduction in\nbone mineral density. Selpercatinib also induced reversible hypocellularity of bone\nmarrow in males at \u226530 mg/kg (approximately equivalent to or greater than the adult\nhuman exposure at the clinical dose of 160 mg twice daily), and reversible alterations of\ndentin composition at \u226550 mg/kg (approximately 3 times the adult human exposure at\nthe clinical dose of 160 mg twice daily). Irreversible, dose-dependent degeneration of\ntesticular germinal epithelium, with vacuolation of Sertoli cells and corresponding\ndepletion of spermatozoa in the epididymides, was also observed at \u2265 30 mg/kg\n(approximately equivalent to or greater than the adult human exposure at the clinical\ndose of 160 mg twice daily) and affected male reproductive performance at 50 mg/kg\n(approximately 3 times the adult human exposure at the clinical dose of 160 mg twice\ndaily). Females exhibited delay in attainment of vaginal patency, a marker of sexual\nmaturity, at 125 mg/kg (approximately 4 times the adult human exposure at the clinical\ndose of 160 mg twice daily); this affect was associated with lower mean body weight.\nSimilar effects in irregular thickening of growth plates in adult rats and minipigs, and\ntooth dysplasia and malocclusion, resulting in tooth loss in adult rats were observed in\nrepeat dose studies of up to 13-week duration with selpercatinib.\nMonitor growth plates in pediatric patients with open growth plates. Consider\ninterrupting or discontinuing therapy based on the severity of any growth plate\nabnormalities and based on an individual risk-benefit assessment.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 796 patients who received RETEVMO, 34% (268 patients) were \u226565 years of age and\n9% (74 patients) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences were observed in the\nsafety or effectiveness of RETEVMO between patients who were \u226565 years of age and\nyounger patients.\n8.6 Renal Impairment\nNo dosage modification is recommended for patients with mild to severe renal\nimpairment [estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) \u226515 to 89 mL/min, estimated by\nModification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation]. The recommended dosage has\nnot been established for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.3)].\n8.7 Hepatic Impairment\nReduce the dose when administering RETEVMO to patients with severe [total bilirubin\ngreater than 3 to 10 times upper limit of normal (ULN) and any AST] hepatic impairment\n[see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. No dosage modification is recommended for\npatients with mild (total bilirubin less than or equal to ULN with AST greater than ULN or\ntotal bilirubin greater than 1 to 1.5 times ULN with any AST) or moderate (total bilirubin\ngreater than 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. Monitor for\nRETEVMO-related adverse reactions in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.3)].\n11 DESCRIPTION\nRETEVMO contains selpercatinib, a kinase inhibitor. The molecular formula for\nselpercatinib is C\nH\nN O  and the molecular weight is 525.61 g/mol. The chemical\nname is 6-(2-hydroxy-2-methylpropoxy)-4-(6-(6-((6-methoxypyridin-3-yl)methyl)-3,6-\ndiazabicyclo[3.1.1]heptan-3-yl)pyridin-3-yl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-3-carbonitrile.\nSelpercatinib has the following chemical structure:\n29\n31\n7\n3\nSelpercatinib is a white to light yellow powder that is slightly hygroscopic. The aqueous\nsolubility of selpercatinib is pH dependent, from sparingly soluble at low pH to practically\ninsoluble at neutral pH.\nRETEVMO capsules contain either 40 mg or 80 mg of selpercatinib in hard gelatin\ncapsules for oral use. Each capsule contains inactive ingredients of colloidal silicon\ndioxide and microcrystalline cellulose. The 40 mg capsule shell is composed of gelatin,\ntitanium dioxide, ferric oxide black and black ink. The 80 mg capsule shell is composed\nof gelatin, titanium dioxide, FD&C blue #1 and black ink. The black ink is composed of\nshellac, potassium hydroxide and ferric oxide black.\nRETEVMO tablets contain 40 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg or 160 mg of selpercatinib as film\ncoated, debossed tablets for oral use. Each tablet contains inactive ingredients of\ncroscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, and\nsodium stearyl fumarate. The tablet film coating material contains polyvinyl alcohol,\ntitanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, and talc. Additionally, the film coating of the 40 mg,\n80 mg, and 120 mg tablets contains ferrosoferric oxide and the film coating of the 80\nmg, 120 mg, and 160 mg tablets contain ferric oxide.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nSelpercatinib is a kinase inhibitor. Selpercatinib inhibited wild-type RET and multiple\nmutated RET isoforms as well as VEGFR1 and VEGFR3 with IC\n values ranging from\n0.92 nM to 67.8 nM. In other enzyme assays, selpercatinib also inhibited FGFR 1, 2, and\n3 at higher concentrations that were still clinically achievable. In cellular assays,\nselpercatinib inhibited RET at approximately 60-fold lower concentrations than FGFR1\nand 2 and approximately 8-fold lower concentration than VEGFR3.\nCertain point mutations in RET or chromosomal rearrangements involving in-frame\nfusions of RET with various partners can result in constitutively activated chimeric RET\nfusion proteins that can act as oncogenic drivers by promoting cell proliferation of\ntumor cell lines. In in vitro and in vivo tumor models, selpercatinib demonstrated anti-\ntumor activity in cells harboring constitutive activation of RET proteins resulting from\ngene fusions and mutations, including CCDC6-RET, KIF5B-RET, RET V804M, and RET\nM918T. In addition, selpercatinib showed anti-tumor activity in mice intracranially\nimplanted with a patient-derived RET fusion positive tumor.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nExposure-Response Relationship\nSelpercatinib exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic\nresponse have not been fully characterized.\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nThe effect of RETEVMO on the QTc interval was evaluated in a thorough QT study in\nhealthy subjects. The largest mean increase in QTc is predicted to be 10.6 msec (upper\n90% confidence interval: 12.1 msec) at the mean steady-state maximum concentration\n(C\n) observed in patients after administration of 160 mg twice daily. The increase in\n50\nmax\nQTc was concentration-dependent.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of selpercatinib capsules were evaluated in patients with locally\nadvanced or metastatic solid tumors administered 160 mg twice daily unless otherwise\nspecified. The capsule and tablet dosage forms of selpercatinib are bioequivalent. Steady\nstate selpercatinib AUC and C\n increased in a slightly greater than dose proportional\nmanner over the dose range of 20 mg once daily to 240 mg twice daily [0.06 to 1.5\ntimes the maximum recommended total daily dosage].\nSteady-state was reached by approximately 7 days and the median accumulation ratio\nafter administration of 160 mg twice daily was 3.4-fold. Mean steady-state selpercatinib\n[coefficient of variation (CV%)] C\n was 2,980 (53%) ng/mL and AUC\n was 51,600\n(58%) ng*h/mL.\nAbsorption\nThe median t\n of selpercatinib is 2 hours. The mean absolute bioavailability of\nRETEVMO capsules is 73% (60% to 82%) in healthy subjects.\nEffect of Food\nFor both the capsule and tablet dosage forms no clinically significant differences in\nselpercatinib AUC or C\n were observed following administration of a high-fat meal\n(approximately 900 calories, 58 grams carbohydrate, 56 grams fat and 43 grams\nprotein) in healthy subjects.\nDistribution\nThe apparent volume of distribution (V\n/F) of selpercatinib is 191 L.\nProtein binding of selpercatinib is 96% in vitro and is independent of concentration. The\nblood-to-plasma concentration ratio is 0.7.\nElimination\nThe apparent clearance (CL/F) of selpercatinib is 6 L/h in patients and the half-life is\n32 hours following oral administration of RETEVMO in healthy subjects.\nMetabolism\nSelpercatinib is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4. Following oral administration of\na single radiolabeled 160 mg dose of selpercatinib to healthy subjects, unchanged\nselpercatinib constituted 86% of the radioactive drug components in plasma.\nExcretion\nFollowing oral administration of a single radiolabeled 160 mg dose of selpercatinib to\nhealthy subjects, 69% of the administered dose was recovered in feces (14%\nunchanged) and 24% in urine (12% unchanged).\nSpecific Populations\nThe apparent volume of distribution and clearance of selpercatinib increase with\nincreasing body weight (9.6 kg to 179 kg).\nNo clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of selpercatinib were\nobserved based on age (2 years to 92 years), sex, or mild, moderate, or severe renal\nmax\nmax\nmax\n0-24h\nmax\nmax\nss\nimpairment (eGFR \u226515 to 89 mL/min). The effect of ESRD on selpercatinib\npharmacokinetics has not been studied.\nPediatric patients\nThe exposures of selpercatinib in pediatric patients are predicted to be comparable to\nthose in adult patients administered at the recommended dosages.\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\nThe selpercatinib AUC\n increased 1.07 fold, 1.32 fold, and 1.77 fold in subjects with\nmild (total bilirubin less than or equal to ULN with AST greater than ULN or total bilirubin\ngreater than 1 to 1.5 times ULN with any AST), moderate (total bilirubin greater than 1.5\nto 3 times ULN and any AST), and severe (total bilirubin greater than 3 to 10 times ULN\nand any AST) hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with normal\nhepatic function.\nDrug Interaction Studies\nClinical Studies and Model-Informed Approaches\nProton-Pump Inhibitors (PPI): Coadministration with multiple daily doses of omeprazole\n(PPI) decreased selpercatinib AUC\n and C\n when RETEVMO was administered\nfasting. Coadministration with multiple daily doses of omeprazole did not significantly\nchange the selpercatinib AUC\n and C\n when RETEVMO was administered with food\n(Table 10).\nTable 10: Change in Selpercatinib Exposure After Coadministration with PPI\n High-fat meal: approximately 150, 250, and 500-600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat,\nrespectively; approximately 800 to 1,000 calories total.\n Low-fat meal: approximately 390 calories and 10 g of fat.\nSelpercatinib \nAUC\nSelpercatinib \nC\nRETEVMO fasting\nReference\nReference\nRETEVMO fasting + PPI\n\u2193 69%\n\u2193 88%\nRETEVMO with a high-fat meal\n+ PPI\n\u2191 2%\n\u2193 49%\nRETEVMO with a low-fat meal  +\nPPI\nNo change\n\u2193 22%\nH2 Receptor Antagonists: No clinically significant differences in selpercatinib\npharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered with multiple daily doses of\nranitidine (H2 receptor antagonist) given 10 hours prior to and 2 hours after the\nRETEVMO dose (administered fasting).\nStrong CYP3A Inhibitors: Coadministration of multiple doses of itraconazole (strong\nCYP3A inhibitor) increased the selpercatinib AUC\n 2.33 fold and C\n 1.3 fold.\nModerate CYP3A Inhibitors: Coadministration of multiple doses of diltiazem, fluconazole,\nor verapamil (moderate CYP3A inhibitors) is predicted to increase the selpercatinib AUC\n1.6 to 1.99 fold and C\n 1.46 to 1.76 fold.\nStrong CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of multiple doses of rifampin (strong CYP3A\n0-INF\n0-INF\nmax\n0-INF\nmax\n1\n2\n0-INF\nmax\n1\n2\n0-INF\nmax\nmax\ninducer) decreased the selpercatinib AUC\n by 87% and C\n by 70%.\nModerate CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of multiple doses of bosentan or efavirenz\n(moderate CYP3A inducers) is predicted to decrease the selpercatinib AUC by 40-70%\nand C\n by 34-57%.\nWeak CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of multiple doses of modafinil (weak CYP3A\ninducer) is predicted to decrease the selpercatinib AUC by 33% and C\n by 26%.\nCYP2C8 Substrates: Coadministration of RETEVMO with repaglinide (sensitive CYP2C8\nsubstrate) increased the repaglinide AUC\n 2.88 fold and C\n 1.91 fold.\nCYP3A Substrates: Coadministration of RETEVMO with midazolam (sensitive CYP3A\nsubstrate) increased the midazolam AUC\n 1.54 fold and C\n 1.39 fold.\nP-glycoprotein (P-gp) Substrates: Coadministration of RETEVMO with dabigatran (P-gp\nsubstrate) increased the dabigatran AUC\n 1.38 fold and C\n 1.43 fold.\nP-gp Inhibitors: No clinically significant differences in selpercatinib pharmacokinetics were\nobserved when coadministered with a single dose of rifampin (P-gp inhibitor).\nMATE1 Substrates: No clinically significant differences in glucose levels were observed\nwhen metformin (MATE1 substrate) was coadministered with selpercatinib.\nIn Vitro Studies\nCYP Enzymes: Selpercatinib does not inhibit or induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9,\nCYP2C19, or CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations.\nTransporter Systems: Selpercatinib inhibits MATE1 and BCRP, but does not inhibit OAT1,\nOAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BSEP, and MATE2-K at clinically relevant\nconcentrations. Selpercatinib may increase serum creatinine by decreasing renal tubular\nsecretion of creatinine via inhibition of MATE1 [see Adverse Effects (6.1)]. Selpercatinib is\na substrate for P-gp and BCRP, but not for OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1,\nOATP1B3, MATE1, or MATE2-K.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with selpercatinib. Selpercatinib was\nnot mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assays, with or without\nmetabolic activation, or clastogenic in the in vitro micronucleus assay in human\nperipheral lymphocytes, with or without metabolic activation. Selpercatinib was positive\nin the in vivo micronucleus assay in rats at concentrations >7 times the C\n at the\nhuman dose of 160 mg twice daily.\nIn general toxicology studies, male rats and minipigs exhibited testicular degeneration\nwhich was associated with luminal cell debris and/or reduced luminal sperm in the\nepididymis at selpercatinib exposures approximately 0.4 (rat) and 0.1 (minipig) times the\nclinical exposure by AUC at the recommended human dose. In a dedicated fertility study\nin male rats, administration of selpercatinib at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately\ntwice the clinical exposure by AUC at the 160 twice daily dose) for 28 days prior to\ncohabitation with untreated females did not affect mating or have clear effects on\nfertility. Males did, however, display a dose-dependent increase in testicular germ cell\n0-INF\nmax\nmax\nmax\n0-INF\nmax\n0-INF\nmax\n0-INF\nmax\nmax\ndepletion and spermatid retention at doses \u22653 mg/kg (~0.2 times the clinical exposure\nby AUC at the 160 twice daily dose) accompanied by altered sperm morphology at\n30 mg/kg.\nIn a dedicated fertility study in female rats treated with selpercatinib for 15 days before\nmating to Gestational Day 7, there were decreases in the number of estrous cycles at a\ndose of 75 mg/kg (approximately equal to the human exposure by AUC at the 160 mg\ntwice daily clinical dose). While selpercatinib did not have clear effects on mating\nperformance or ability to become pregnant at any dose level, half of females at the\n75 mg/kg dose level had 100% nonviable embryos. At the same dose level in females\nwith some viable embryos there were increases in post-implantation loss. In a 3-month\ngeneral toxicology study in minipigs, there were findings of decreased or absent corpora\nlutea at a selpercatinib dose of 15 mg/kg (approximately 0.3 times to the human\nexposure by AUC at the 160 mg twice daily clinical dose). Corpora luteal cysts were\npresent in the minipig at selpercatinib doses \u22652 mg/kg (approximately 0.07 times the\nhuman exposure by AUC at the 160 mg twice daily clinical dose).\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 RET Fusion-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\nThe efficacy of RETEVMO was evaluated in patients with advanced RET fusion-positive\nNSCLC enrolled in a multicenter, open-label, multi-cohort clinical trial (LIBRETTO-001,\nNCT03157128). The study enrolled patients with advanced or metastatic RET fusion-\npositive NSCLC who had progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy and patients with\nlocally advanced (stage III who were not candidates for surgical resection or definitive\nchemoradiation) or metastatic NSCLC without prior systemic therapy in separate\ncohorts.

Testing for the presence of MET\nexon 14 skipping alterations in plasma specimens is recommended only in patients for\nwhom a tumor biopsy cannot be obtained. If an alteration is not detected in a plasma\nspecimen, re-evaluate the feasibility of biopsy for tumor tissue testing. An FDA-approved\ntest for detection of MET exon 14 skipping alterations in NSCLC for selecting patients for\ntreatment with TEPMETKO is not available.\n2.2 Recommended Dosage\nThe recommended dosage of TEPMETKO is 450 mg orally once daily with food [see\nClinical Pharmacology (12.3)] until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\nInstruct patients to take their dose of TEPMETKO at approximately the same time every\nday and to swallow tablets whole. Do not chew, crush or split tablets. Patients who have\ndifficulty swallowing solids can disperse tablets in water [see Dosage and Administration\n(2.3)].\nAdvise patients not to make up a missed dose within 8 hours of the next scheduled\ndose.\nIf vomiting occurs after taking a dose of TEPMETKO, advise patients to take the next\ndose at the scheduled time.\n2.3 Administration to Patients Who Have Difficulty Swallowing Solids\nPlace TEPMETKO tablet(s) in a glass containing 30 mL (1 ounce) of non-carbonated\nwater. No other liquids should be used or added. Stir, without crushing, until the\ntablet(s) is dispersed into small pieces (tablets will not completely dissolve) and drink\nimmediately or within 1 hour. Swallow the tablet dispersion. Do not chew pieces of the\ntablet. Rinse the glass with an additional 30 mL and drink immediately ensuring no\nresidue remains in the glass and the full dose is administered.\nIf an administration via a naso-gastric tube (with at least 8 French gauge) is required,\ndisperse the tablet(s) in 30 mL of non-carbonated water as described above. Administer\nthe 30 mL of liquid immediately or within 1 hour as per naso-gastric tube manufacturer's\ninstructions. Immediately rinse twice with 30 mL each time to ensure that no residue\nremains in the glass or syringe and the full dose is administered.\n2.4 Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions\nThe recommended dose reduction of TEPMETKO for the management of adverse\nreactions is 225 mg orally once daily.\nPermanently discontinue TEPMETKO in patients who are unable to tolerate 225 mg orally\nonce daily.\nThe recommended dosage modifications of TEPMETKO for adverse reactions are\nprovided in Table 1.\nTable 1: Recommended TEPMETKO Dosage Modifications for Adverse\nReactions\nAdverse Reaction\nSeverity\nDose Modification\nInterstitial Lung Disease\n(ILD)/Pneumonitis [see\nWarnings and\nPrecautions (5.1)]\nAny Grade\nWithhold TEPMETKO if ILD is\nsuspected.\nPermanently discontinue\nTEPMETKO if ILD is confirmed.\nIncreased ALT and/or\nAST without increased\ntotal bilirubin [see\nWarnings and\nPrecautions (5.2)]\nGrade 3\nWithhold TEPMETKO until\nrecovery to baseline ALT/AST.\nIf recovered to baseline within\n7 days, then resume\nTEPMETKO at the same dose;\notherwise resume TEPMETKO\nat a reduced dose.\nGrade 4\nPermanently discontinue\nTEPMETKO.\nIncreased ALT and/or\nAST with increased\ntotal bilirubin in the\nabsence of cholestasis\nor hemolysis [see\nWarnings and\nPrecautions (5.2)]\nALT and/or AST greater\nthan 3 times ULN with\ntotal bilirubin greater\nthan 2 times ULN\nPermanently discontinue\nTEPMETKO.\nIncreased total bilirubin\nwithout concurrent\nincreased ALT and/or\nAST [see Warnings and\nPrecautions (5.2)]\nGrade 3\nWithhold TEPMETKO until\nrecovery to baseline bilirubin.\nIf recovered to baseline within\n7 days, then resume\nTEPMETKO at a reduced dose;\notherwise permanently\ndiscontinue.\nGrade 4\nPermanently discontinue\nTEPMETKO.\nIncreased lipase or\namylase [see Warnings\nand Precautions (5.3)]\nGrade 3\nWithhold TEPMETKO until \u2264\nGrade 2 or baseline.\nIf recovered to baseline or \u2264\nGrade 2 within 14 days,\nresume TEPMETKO at a\nreduced dose; otherwise\npermanently discontinue\nTEPMETKO.\nGrade 4\nPermanently discontinue\nTEPMETKO.\nPancreatitis [see\nWarnings and\nGrade 3 or 4\nPermanently discontinue\n*\n*\nWarnings and\nPrecautions (5.3)]\nGrade 3 or 4\nTEPMETKO.\nOther adverse\nreactions [see Adverse\nReactions (6.1)]\nGrade 2\nMaintain dose level.

ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 2% patients treated with\nTEPMETKO, with one patient experiencing a Grade 3 or higher event; this event resulted\nin death. Five patients (1%) discontinued TEPMETKO due to ILD/pneumonitis.\nMonitor patients for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of\nILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold TEPMETKO in\npatients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue if no other\npotential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\n5.2 Hepatotoxicity\nHepatotoxicity occurred in patients treated with TEPMETKO [see Adverse Reactions\n(6.1)]. Increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/increased aspartate aminotransferase\n(AST) occurred in 18% of patients treated with TEPMETKO. Grade 3 or 4 increased\nALT/AST occurred in 4.7% of patients. A fatal adverse reaction of hepatic failure\noccurred in one patient (0.2%). Four patients (0.8%) discontinued TEPMETKO due to\nincreased ALT/AST. The median time-to-onset of Grade 3 or higher increased ALT/AST\nwas 47 days (range 1 to 262).\nMonitor liver function tests (including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin) prior to the start of\nTEPMETKO, every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month or\nas clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop increased\nSeverity as defined by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for\nAdverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.\ntransaminases or bilirubin. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold, dose\nreduce, or permanently discontinue TEPMETKO [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\n5.3 Pancreatic Toxicity\nElevations in amylase and lipase levels occurred in patients treated with TEPMETKO [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)]. Increased amylase and/or lipase occurred in 13% of patients\ntreated with TEPMETKO. Grade 3 and 4 increased amylase and/or lipase occurred in 5%\nand 1.2% of patients, respectively. Monitor amylase and lipase at baseline and regularly\nduring treatment with TEPMETKO. Based on the severity of the adverse drug reaction,\ntemporarily withhold, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue TEPMETKO [see Dosage\nand Administration (2.4)].\n5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on findings in animal studies and its mechanism of action TEPMETKO can cause\nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Oral administration of tepotinib to\npregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations\n(teratogenicity) and anomalies at exposures less than the human exposure based on\narea under the curve (AUC) at the 450 mg daily clinical dose. Advise pregnant women of\nthe potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential or males with\nfemale partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during\ntreatment with TEPMETKO and for one week after the last dose. [See Use in Specific\nPopulations (8.1, 8.3)]\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are described in greater detail elsewhere in the labeling:\nInterstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nHepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nPancreatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect\nexposure to TEPMETKO in 506 patients with solid tumors enrolled in five open-label,\nsingle-arm studies receiving TEPMETKO as single agent at a dose of 450 mg once daily.\nThis included 313 patients with NSCLC positive for METex14 skipping alterations, who\nreceived TEPMETKO in VISION. Among 506 patients who received TEPMETKO, 44% were\nexposed for 6 months or longer, and 22% were exposed for more than one year.\nThe data described below reflect exposure to TEPMETKO 450 mg once daily in 313\npatients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with METex14 skipping\nalterations in VISION [see Clinical Studies (14)].\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 51% of patients who received TEPMETKO. Serious\nadverse reactions in > 2% of patients included pleural effusion (6%), pneumonia (6%),\nedema (5%), general health deterioration (3.8%), dyspnea (3.5%), musculoskeletal pain\n(2.9%), and pulmonary embolism (2.2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.9% of\npatients who received TEPMETKO, including pneumonitis (0.3%), hepatic failure (0.3%),\ndyspnea from fluid overload (0.3%), pneumonia (0.3%), sepsis (0.3%), and death of\nunknown cause (0.3%).\nPermanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 25% of patients who\nreceived TEPMETKO. The most frequent adverse reactions (> 1%) leading to permanent\ndiscontinuations of TEPMETKO were edema (8%), pleural effusion (1.6%), and general\nhealth deterioration (1.6%).\nDosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 53% of patients who\nreceived TEPMETKO. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in > 2% of\npatients who received TEPMETKO included edema (28%), increased blood creatinine\n(6%), pleural effusion (3.5%), nausea (3.2%), increased ALT (2.9%), pneumonia (2.6%),\ndecreased appetite (2.2%), and dyspnea (2.2%).\nDose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 36% of patients who received\nTEPMETKO. Adverse reactions which required dose reductions in > 2% of patients who\nreceived TEPMETKO included edema (22%), increased blood creatinine (2.9%), fatigue\n(2.2%), and pleural effusion (2.2%).\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) in patients who received TEPMETKO were\nedema, nausea, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, dyspnea, decreased appetite,\nand rash. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities (\u2265 2%) were\ndecreased lymphocytes, decreased albumin, decreased sodium, increased gamma-\nglutamyltransferase, increased amylase, increased lipase, increased ALT, increased AST,\nand decreased hemoglobin.\nTable 2 summarizes the adverse reactions in VISION.\nTable 2: Adverse Reactions in \u2265 10% of Patients with NSCLC with\nMETex14 Skipping Alterations Who Received TEPMETKO in VISION\nAdverse Reactions\nTEPMETKO\n(N=313)\nAll Grades  \n(%)\nGrades 3 to 4  \n(%)\nGeneral disorders and administration-site conditions\n  Edema\n81\n16\n  Fatigue\n30\n1.9\nGastrointestinal disorders\n  Nausea\n31\n1.3\n  Diarrhea\n29\n0.6\n  Abdominal pain\n19\n0.6\n  Constipation\n19\n0.3\n  Vomiting\n15\n1\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders\n  Musculoskeletal pain\n30\n3.2\nRespiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders\n  Dyspnea\n24\n2.6\n  Cough\n18\n0.3\n*\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\n#\n\u00de\n\u00df\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\n#\n\u00de\n\u00df\n\u00e0\n\u00e8\n  Pleural effusion\n14\n4.2\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\n  Decreased appetite\n21\n1.9\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders\n  Rash\n21\n1.3\nInfections and Infestations\n  Pneumonia\n12\n3.8\nClinically relevant adverse reactions in < 10% of patients who received TEPMETKO\nincluded ILD/pneumonitis, fever, dizziness, pruritus, and headache.\nTable 3 summarizes the laboratory abnormalities observed in VISION.\nTable 3: Select Laboratory Abnormalities (\u2265 20%) That Worsened\nfrom Baseline in Patients Who Received TEPMETKO in VISION\nLaboratory Abnormalities\nTEPMETKO\nGrades 1 to 4  \n(%)\nGrades 3 to 4  \n(%)\nChemistry\n  Decreased albumin\n81\n9\n  Increased creatinine\n60\n1\n  Increased alkaline phosphatase\naminotransferase\n52\n1.6\n  Increased alanine aminotransferase\n50\n4.9\n  Increased aspartate aminotransferase\n40\n3.6\n  Decreased sodium\n36\n9\n  Increased gamma-\nglutamyltransferase\n29\n6\n  Increased potassium\n26\n1.9\n  Increased amylase\n25\n5\n  Increased lipase\n21\n5\nSeverity as defined by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for\nAdverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03.\nEdema includes eye edema, face edema, generalized edema, localized edema, edema,\ngenital edema, peripheral edema, peripheral swelling, periorbital edema, and scrotal\nedema.\nFatigue includes asthenia and fatigue.\nAbdominal pain includes abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, abdominal pain lower,\nabdominal pain upper, gastrointestinal pain, and hepatic pain.\nVomiting includes retching and vomiting.\nMusculoskeletal pain includes arthralgia, arthritis, back pain, bone pain, musculoskeletal\nchest pain, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, non-cardiac chest pain, pain in extremity, and\nspinal pain.\nDyspnea includes dyspnea, dyspnea at rest, and dyspnea exertional.\nCough includes cough, and productive cough.\nRash includes rash, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, rash maculo-\npapular, eczema, exfoliative rash, rash erythematous, rash pustular, skin exfoliation,\ndermatitis acneiform, drug eruption, dermatitis, rash pruritic, dermatitis bullous, toxic\nskin eruption.\nPneumonia includes pneumonia, pneumonia aspiration, and pneumonia bacterial.\n\u00e0\n\u00e8\n*\n\u2020\n\u2020\n*\n\u2020\nHematology\n  Decreased lymphocytes\n57\n15\n  Decreased hemoglobin\n31\n3.6\n  Decreased leukocytes\n25\n1.9\n  Decreased platelets\n24\n0.6\nIncreased Creatinine\nA median increase in serum creatinine of 30% was observed 21 days after initiation of\ntreatment with TEPMETKO. The serum creatinine increases persisted throughout\ntreatment and were reversible upon treatment completion.\n7 DRUG INTERACTIONS\n7.1 Effects of TEPMETKO on Other Drugs\nCertain P-gp Substrates\nTepotinib is a P-gp inhibitor. Concomitant use of TEPMETKO increases the concentration\nof P-gp substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the incidence\nand severity of adverse reactions of these substrates. Avoid concomitant use of\nTEPMETKO with certain P-gp substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead\nto serious or life-threatening toxicities. If concomitant use is unavoidable, reduce the P-\ngp substrate dosage if recommended in its approved product labeling.\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on findings in animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.1)], TEPMETKO can cause fetal harm when administered to a\npregnant woman. There are no available data on the use of TEPMETKO in pregnant\nwomen. Oral administration of tepotinib to pregnant rabbits during the period of\norganogenesis resulted in malformations (teratogenicity) and anomalies at maternal\nexposures less than the human exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the\n450 mg daily clinical dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a\nfetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nThe denominator used to calculate the rate varied from 268 to 309 based on the\nnumber of patients with a baseline value and at least one post-treatment value.\nSeverity as defined by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for\nAdverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03.\nIn embryo-fetal development studies, pregnant rabbits received oral doses of 0.5, 5, 25,\n50, 150, or 450 mg/kg tepotinib hydrochloride hydrate daily during organogenesis.\nSevere maternal toxicity occurred at the 450 mg/kg dose (approximately 0.75 times the\nhuman exposure at the 450 mg clinical dose). At 150 mg/kg (approximately 0.5 times\nthe human exposure by AUC at the 450 mg clinical dose), two animals aborted and one\nanimal died prematurely; mean fetal body weight was also decreased. A dose-dependent\nincrease of skeletal malformations, including malrotations of fore and/or hind paws with\nconcomitant misshapen scapula and/or malpositioned clavicle and/or calcaneous and/or\ntalus, occurred at doses \u2265 5 mg/kg (approximately 0.003 times the human exposure by\nAUC at the 450 mg clinical dose); there was also an incidence of spina bifida at the 5\nmg/kg dose level.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data regarding the secretion of tepotinib or its metabolites in human milk or\nits effects on the breastfed infant or milk production. Advise women not to breastfeed\nduring treatment with TEPMETKO and for one week after the last dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nBased on animal data, TEPMETKO can cause malformations at doses less than the\nhuman exposure based on AUC at the 450 mg clinical dose [see Use in Specific\nPopulations (8.1)].\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TEPMETKO\n[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nContraception\nFemales\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during\nTEPMETKO treatment and for one week after the last dose.\nMales\nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective\ncontraception during TEPMETKO treatment and for one week after the last dose.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and efficacy of TEPMETKO in pediatric patients have not been established.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 313 patients with NSCLC positive for METex14 skipping alterations in VISION who\nreceived 450 mg TEPMETKO once daily, 79% were 65 years or older, and 41% were 75\nyears or older. No clinically important differences in safety or efficacy were observed\nbetween patients aged 65 years or older and younger patients.\n8.6 Renal Impairment\nNo dosage modification is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal\nimpairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 30 to 89 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault).\nThe recommended dosage has not been established for patients with severe renal\nimpairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n8.7 Hepatic Impairment\nNo dosage modification is recommended in patients with mild (Child Pugh Class A) or\nmoderate (Child Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics and safety of\ntepotinib in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C) have not been\nstudied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n11 DESCRIPTION\nTepotinib is a kinase inhibitor. TEPMETKO (tepotinib) tablets for oral use are formulated\nwith tepotinib hydrochloride hydrate. The chemical name for tepotinib hydrochloride\nhydrate is 3-{1-[(3-{5-[(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)methoxy]pyrimidin-2-yl}phenyl)methyl]-6-\noxo-1,6-dihydropyridazin-3-yl}benzonitrile hydrochloride hydrate. The molecular formula\nis C\nH\nN O \u2219HCl\u2219H O and the molecular weight is 547.05 g/mol for tepotinib\nhydrochloride hydrate and 492.58 g/mol for tepotinib (free base). The chemical\nstructure is shown below:\nTepotinib hydrochloride hydrate is a white to off-white powder with a pKa of 9.5.\nTEPMETKO is supplied as film-coated tablets containing 225 mg of tepotinib (equivalent\nto 250 mg tepotinib hydrochloride hydrate). Inactive ingredients in the tablet core are\nmannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, and colloidal\nsilicon dioxide. The tablet coating consists of hypromellose, titanium dioxide, lactose\nmonohydrate, polyethylene glycol, triacetin, and red iron oxides.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nTepotinib is a kinase inhibitor that targets MET, including variants with exon 14 skipping\nalterations. Tepotinib inhibits hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-dependent and -\nindependent MET phosphorylation and MET-dependent downstream signaling pathways.\nTepotinib also inhibited melatonin 2 and imidazoline 1 receptors at clinically achievable\nconcentrations.\nIn vitro, tepotinib inhibited tumor cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and\n29\n28\n6\n2\n2\nmigration of MET-dependent tumor cells. In mice implanted with tumor cell lines with\noncogenic activation of MET, including METex14 skipping alterations, tepotinib inhibited\ntumor growth, led to sustained inhibition of MET phosphorylation, and, in one model,\ndecreased the formation of metastases.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nExposure-Response\nTepotinib exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic\nresponse have not been fully characterized.\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nAt the recommended dosage, no large mean increases in QTc (i.e. > 20 ms) were\ndetected in patients with various solid tumors. A concentration-dependent increase in\nQTc interval was observed. The QTc effect of tepotinib at high clinical exposures has not\nbeen evaluated.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of tepotinib were evaluated in patients with cancer administered\n450 mg once daily unless otherwise specified. Tepotinib exposure (AUC\n and C\n)\nincreases dose-proportionally over the dose range of 27 mg (0.06 times the\nrecommended daily dosage) to 450 mg. At the recommended dosage, the geometric\nmean (coefficient of variation [CV] %) steady state C\n was 1,291 ng/mL (48.1%) and\nthe AUC\n was 27,438 ng\u2219h/mL (51.7%). The oral clearance of tepotinib did not\nchange with respect to time. The median accumulation was 2.5-fold for C\n and 3.3-\nfold for AUC\n after multiple daily doses of tepotinib.\nAbsorption\nThe median T\n of tepotinib is 8 hours (range from 6 to 12 hours). The geometric\nmean (CV%) absolute bioavailability of TEPMETKO in the fed state was 71.6% (10.8%) in\nhealthy subjects.\nEffect of Food\nThe mean AUC\n of tepotinib increased by 1.6-fold and C\n increased by 2-fold,\nfollowing administration of a high-fat, high-calorie meal (approximately 800 to 1,000\ncalories, 150 calories from protein, 250 calories from carbohydrate, and 500 to 600\ncalories from fat). The median T\n shifted from 12 hours to 8 hours.\nDistribution\nThe geometric mean (CV%) apparent volume of distribution (V /F) of tepotinib is 1,038 L\n(24.3%). Protein binding of tepotinib is 98% and is independent of drug concentration at\nclinically relevant exposures.\nElimination\nThe apparent clearance (CL/F) of tepotinib is 23.8 L/h (87.5%) and the half-life is 32\nhours following oral administration of TEPMETKO in patients with cancer.\nMetabolism\nTepotinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. One major circulating plasma\n0-12h\nmax\nmax\n0-24h\nmax\n0-24h\nmax\n0-INF\nmax\nmax\nZ\nmetabolite (M506) has been identified.\nExcretion\nFollowing a single oral administration of a radiolabeled dose of 450 mg tepotinib,\napproximately 85% of the dose was recovered in feces (45% unchanged) and 13.6% in\nurine (7% unchanged). The major circulating metabolite M506 accounted for about\n40.4% of the total radioactivity in plasma.\nSpecific Populations\nNo clinically significant effects on tepotinib pharmacokinetics were observed based on\nage (18 to 89 years), race/ethnicity (White, Black, Asian, Japanese, and Hispanic), sex,\nbody weight (35.5 to 136 kg), mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 89\nmL/min), or mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and B). The effect of\nsevere renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh\nC) on the pharmacokinetics of tepotinib has not been studied.\nDrug Interaction Studies\nClinical Studies and Model-Informed Approaches\nNo clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of tepotinib were observed\nwhen coadministered with the following drugs: itraconazole (strong CYP3A and P-gp\ninhibitor), carbamazepine (strong CYP3A inducer) or omeprazole (proton pump\ninhibitor/acid reducing agent) under fed conditions.\nNo clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs were\nobserved or predicted when coadministered with tepotinib: midazolam (sensitive CYP3A\nsubstrate) or CYP2C9 substrates.\nP-gp Substrates: Coadministration of TEPMETKO with dabigatran etexilate (P-gp\nsubstrate) increased dabigatran C\n by 40% and AUC\n by 50%.\nMATE2 and OCT2 Substrates: No clinically relevant differences in glucose levels were\nobserved when metformin (MATE2 and OCT2 substrate) was coadministered with\ntepotinib.\nIn Vitro Studies\nCytochrome P450 Enzymes: Tepotinib is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. Tepotinib\nand M506 do not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or\nCYP2E1, and do not induce CYP1A2 or 2B6 at clinically relevant concentrations.\nUDP-Glucuronosyltransferase (UGT): Tepotinib and M506 do not inhibit UGT 1A1, 1A9,\n2B17, 1A3/4/6 and 2B7/15 at clinically relevant concentrations.\nTransporter Systems: Tepotinib is a P-gp substrate. Tepotinib may inhibit intestinal BCRP\nat clinically relevant concentrations. Tepotinib does not inhibit bile salt export pump\n(BSEP), organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, B3, or organic anion\ntransporter (OAT) 1 and 3.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nmax\n0-INF\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed with tepotinib. Tepotinib and its major\ncirculating metabolite were not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation\n(Ames) assay  or a mouse lymphoma assay. In vivo, tepotinib was not genotoxic in a rat\nmicronucleus test.\nFertility studies of tepotinib have not been performed. There were no morphological\nchanges in male or female reproductive organs in repeat-dose toxicity studies in dogs.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of TEPMETKO was evaluated in a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, non-\nrandomized, multicohort study (VISION, NCT02864992). Eligible patients were required\nto have advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring METex14 skipping alterations,\nepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type and anaplastic lymphoma kinase\n(ALK) negative status, at least one measurable lesion as defined by Response Evaluation\nCriteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group\n(ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 1. Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases,\nclinically significant uncontrolled cardiac disease, or who received treatment with any\nMET or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) inhibitor were not eligible for the study.\nIdentification of METex14 skipping alterations was prospectively determined using\ncentral laboratories employing either a PCR-based or next-generation sequencing-based\nclinical trial assay using tissue (66%) and/or plasma (57%) samples.\nPatients received TEPMETKO 450 mg once daily until disease progression or\nunacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was confirmed overall\nresponse rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST\nv1.1) as evaluated by a Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC). An additional\nefficacy outcome measure was duration of response (DOR) by BIRC.\nThe efficacy population included 164 treatment na\u00efve patients and 149 previously treated\npatients. The median age was 72 years (range 41 to 94 years); 51% female; 62% White,\n34% Asian; 26% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status\n(PS) 0 and 74% had ECOG PS 1; 49% never smoked; 81% had adenocarcinoma; 94%\nhad metastatic disease; and 13% had CNS metastases. Amongst previously treated\npatients, 84% received prior platinum-based chemotherapy.\nEfficacy results are presented in Table 4.\nTable 4: Efficacy Results in the VISION study\nEfficacy parameter\nTreatment-Na\u00efve\n(N=164)\nPreviously Treated\n(N=149)\nCI: Confidence interval, + denotes ongoing response.\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\nOverall response rate (95% CI) \n57% (49, 65)\n45% (37, 53)\nDuration of Response\n  Range in months\n1.3+, 56.6+\n1.4+, 67.6+\n  Patients with DOR \u2265 6 months\n66%\n66%\n  Patients with DOR \u2265 12 months\n40%\n36%\n,\nBlinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) review.\nConfirmed responses.\nBased on observed duration of response.\n*,\u2020\n\u2021\n\u2021\n\u2021\n16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING\nTEPMETKO (tepotinib) tablets: 225 mg tepotinib, white-pink, oval, biconvex film-coated\ntablet with embossment \"M\" on one side and plain on the other side.\nNDC number\nSize\n44087-5000-3\nBox of 30 tablets: 3 blister cards each containing\n10 tablets\n44087-5000-6\nBox of 60 tablets: 6 blister cards each containing\n10 tablets\nThe blister cards consist of a child-resistant blister foil.\nStore TEPMETKO at 20\u00b0C-25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F-77\u00b0F); excursions permitted to 15\u00b0C-30\u00b0C (59\u00b0F-\n86\u00b0F) [see USP-NF Controlled Room Temperature].

Permanently\ndiscontinue IRESSA if ILD is confirmed [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Adverse\nReactions (6.1)].\n5.2 Hepatotoxicity\nIn patients who received IRESSA across clinical trials, 11.4% of patients had increased\nalanine aminotransferase (ALT), 7.9% of patients had increased aspartate\naminotransferase (AST), and 2.7% of patients had increased bilirubin. Grade 3 or higher\nliver test abnormalities occurred in 5.1% (ALT), 3.0% (AST), and 0.7% (bilirubin) of\npatients. The incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity was 0.04%.\nObtain periodic liver function testing. Withhold IRESSA in patients with worsening liver\nfunction and discontinue in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.4), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].\nConfirmed interstitial lung disease (ILD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nSevere hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nGastrointestinal perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\nPersistent ulcerative keratitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]\n5.3 Gastrointestinal Perforation\nGastrointestinal perforation occurred in three (0.1%) of the 2462 IRESSA-treated\npatients across clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Permanently discontinue\nIRESSA in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.4)].\n5.4 Severe or Persistent Diarrhea\nGrade 3 or 4 diarrhea occurred in 3% of 2462 IRESSA-treated patients across clinical\ntrials. Withhold IRESSA for severe or persistent (up to 14 days) diarrhea [see Dosage\nand Administration (2.4), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n5.5 Ocular Disorders including Keratitis\nOcular disorders [keratitis (0.1%), corneal erosion and aberrant eyelash growth (0.2%),\nconjunctivitis, blepharitis and dry eye (6.7%)] occurred in the 2462 IRESSA-treated\npatients across clinical trials. The incidence of Grade 3 ocular disorders was 0.1% [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)]. Interrupt or discontinue IRESSA for severe, or worsening\nocular disorders [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\n5.6 Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Disorders\nBullous conditions including toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens Johnson syndrome and\nerythema multiforme have been reported from treatment with IRESSA. Erythema\nmultiforme and dermatitis bullous have been reported in two patients (0.08%) across\nNSCLC trials (Study 2, Study 3 and Study 4). IRESSA treatment should be interrupted or\ndiscontinued if the patient develops severe bullous, blistering or exfoliating conditions.\n5.7 Embryo-fetal Toxicity\nBased on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies IRESSA\ncan cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproductive\nstudies, oral administration of gefitinib from organogenesis through weaning resulted in\nfetotoxicity and neonatal death at doses below the recommended human dose. Advise\npregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential\nto use effective contraception during treatment with IRESSA and for at least two weeks\nfollowing completion of therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse drug reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of\nthe labeling:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nInterstitial Lung Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nHepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nGastrointestinal Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\nSevere or Persistent Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]\nOcular Disorders including Keratitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]\nBullous and Exfoliative Skin Disorders [see Warning and Precautions (5.6)]\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe safety of IRESSA is based on the data from 2462 patients with NSCLC who received\nIRESSA 250 mg daily monotherapy in three randomized clinical studies (Study 2, Study 3\nand Study 4). Patients with a history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial\ndisease, radiation pneumonitis that required steroid treatment or any evidence of\nclinically active interstitial lung disease were excluded from these studies.\nControlled Studies:\nStudy 2 was a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial in which 1217 patients were\nrandomized to receive first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC; 607 patients received\nIRESSA 250 mg daily and 589 patients received carboplatin/paclitaxel. The median\nduration of treatment with IRESSA was 5.9 months. The study population characteristics\nwere: median age 57 years, age less than 65 years (73%), female (79%), Asian (100%),\nNSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (100%), never smoker (94%), light ex-smoker (6%),\nECOG PS 0 or 1 (90%).\nStudy 3 was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which\n1692 patients were randomized to receive second- or third-line treatment for metastatic\nNSCLC; of which 1126 patients received IRESSA 250 mg daily and 562 patients received\nplacebo. The median duration of treatment with IRESSA was 2.9 months. The study\npopulation characteristics were: median age 62 years, age less than 65 years (60%),\nfemale (33%), Caucasian (75%), Asian (21%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (48%),\nnever smoker (22%), ECOG PS 0 or 1 (65%), PS 2 (29%), PS 3 (5%) and two or more\nprior therapies (51%).\nStudy 4 was a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial in which 1466 patients were\nrandomized to receive second-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC; 729 patients\nreceived IRESSA 250 mg daily and 715 patients received docetaxel. The median duration\nof treatment with IRESSA was 2.4 months. The study population characteristics were:\nmedian age 61 years, age less than 65 years (61%), female (36%), Caucasian (79%),\nAsian (21%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (54%), never smoker (20%), ECOG PS 0\nor 1 (88%) and two or more prior therapies (16%).\nThe pooled safety database from the three randomized trials was used to evaluate for\nserious and uncommon adverse drug reactions. Common adverse reactions were\nevaluated in Study 3. The most frequent adverse reactions in Study 3 (incidence of\n>20% and greater than placebo) reported in IRESSA-treated patients were skin\nreactions (47%) and diarrhea (29%). The most frequent fatal adverse reactions in\nIRESSA-treated patients were respiratory failure (0.9%), pneumonia (0.8%), and\npulmonary embolism (0.5%).\nApproximately 5% of IRESSA-treated patients and 2.3% of placebo-treated patients\ndiscontinued treatment due to an adverse event. The most frequent adverse reactions\nthat led to discontinuation in patients treated with IRESSA were nausea (0.5%), vomiting\n(0.5%) and diarrhea (0.4%).\nTable 1 - Selected Adverse Drug Reactions Occurring with an Incidence Rate\n\u22655% and an Increase of >2% of IRESSA-treated Patients in Study 3\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\nAdverse Reaction\nPercentage (%) of patients\nIRESSA (N=1126)\nPlacebo (N=562)\nAll Grades Grade 3 and 4 All Grades\nGrade 3 and\n4\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nSkin reactions\n47%\n2%\n17%\n0.4%\nNail disorders\n5%\n0.1%\n0.7%\n0%\nGastrointestinal disorders\nDiarrhea\n29%\n3%\n10%\n1%\nVomiting\n14%\n1.2%\n10%\n0.4%\nStomatitis\n7%\n0.3%\n4%\n0.2%\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nDecreased appetite\n17%\n2.3%\n14%\n2.0%\nEye disorders\nConjunctivitis/blepharitis/dry\neye\n6%\n0%\n3.2%\n0%\nTable 2 - Treatment Emergent Laboratory Abnormalities Occurring More\nFrequently in IRESSA-Treated Patients in Study 3\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\nAdverse Reaction\nIRESSA\nPlacebo\nAll Grades\n%\nGrade 3 and\n4\n%\nAll Grades\n%\nGrade 3 and\n4\n%\nAlanine aminotransferase\nincreased\n38%\n2.4%\n23%\n1.4%\nAspartate aminotransferase\nincreased\n40%\n2.0%\n25%\n1.3%\nProteinuria\n35%\n4.7%\n31%\n3.3%\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with IRESSA across NSCLC trials\n(Study 2, Study 3 and Study 4) and are not listed elsewhere in Section 6: nausea (18%),\nasthenia (17%), pyrexia (9%), alopecia (4.7%), hemorrhage (including epistaxis and\nhematuria) (4.3%), dry mouth (2%), dehydration (1.8%), elevations in blood creatinine\n(1.5%), allergic reactions including angioedema and urticaria (1.1%), palmar-plantar\nIncludes Acne, Acne pustular, Dermatitis, Dermatitis acneiform, Dermatitis exfoliative, Drug\neruption, Dry skin, Erythema, Exfoliative rash, Folliculitis, Pruritus, Pruritus generalized, Rash, Rash\nerythematous, Rash generalized, Rash macular, Rash maculo-papular, Rash papular, Rash pruritic,\nRash pustular, Rash vesicular, Skin exfoliation, Skin toxicity, Xeroderma\nIncludes Ingrowing nail, Nail bed infection, Nail disorder, Nail infection, Onychoclasis, Onycholysis,\nParonychia\nIncludes Diarrhea, Feces soft, Frequent bowel movements\nIncludes Aphthous stomatitis, Cheilitis, Glossodynia, Mouth ulceration, Mucosal inflammation, Oral\nmucosal blistering, Stomatitis, Tongue disorder, Tongue ulceration\nIncludes Blepharitis, Conjunctival hyperemia, Conjunctivitis, Dry eye, Eye irritation, Eye pruritus, Eye\nswelling, Eyelid irritation, Eyelid edema, Eyelids pruritus\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\nPatients were allowed to enter the clinical study with lab values of ALT or AST CTCAE grade 1 or 2\n14% gefitinib patients and 10% placebo patients were CTC grade 1 or 2 ALT at baseline\n0.2% of placebo patients were CTC grade 3 at baseline\n15% gefitinib patients and 12% placebo patients were CTC grade 1 or 2 AST at baseline\n0.4% of placebo patients were CTC grade 3 at baseline\n*\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2021\n*\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\nerythrodysesthesia syndrome (0.2%) and pancreatitis (0.1%).\n6.2 Postmarketing Experience\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of\nIRESSA.

Increase IRESSA to 500 mg daily in patients\nreceiving a strong CYP3A4 inducer (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, or tricyclic\nantidepressant) and resume IRESSA at 250 mg 7 days after discontinuation of the\nstrong inducer [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nCYP3A4 Inhibitor\nDrugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole and itraconazole)\ndecrease gefitinib metabolism and increase gefitinib plasma concentrations. Monitor\nadverse reactions when administering strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with IRESSA.\nDrugs Affecting Gastric pH\nDrugs that elevate gastric pH (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, histamine H -receptor\nantagonists, and antacids) may reduce plasma concentrations of gefitinib. Avoid\nconcomitant use of IRESSA with proton pump inhibitors, if possible. If treatment with a\nproton-pump inhibitor is required, take IRESSA 12 hours after the last dose or 12 hours\nbefore the next dose of the proton-pump inhibitor. Take IRESSA 6 hours after or 6\nhours before an H -receptor antagonist or an antacid [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n7.2 Hemorrhage in Patients taking Warfarin\nInternational Normalized Ratio (INR) elevations and/or hemorrhage have been reported\nin some patients taking warfarin while on IRESSA therapy. Patients taking warfarin\nshould be monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time or INR.\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on its mechanism of action and animal data, IRESSA can cause fetal harm when\nadministered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproductive studies, oral administration\n2\n2\nof gefitinib from organogenesis through weaning resulted in fetotoxicity and neonatal\ndeath at doses below the recommended human dose (see Animal Data). Advise\npregnant women of the potential hazard to a fetus or potential risk for loss of the\npregnancy.\nThe background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population\nis unknown; however, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth\ndefects is 2-4% and miscarriage is 15-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.\nData\nAnimal Data\nA single dose study in rats showed that gefitinib crosses the placenta after an oral dose\nof 5 mg/kg (30 mg/m , about 0.2 times the recommended human dose on a mg/m\nbasis). When pregnant rats were treated with 5 mg/kg from the beginning of\norganogenesis to the end of weaning there was a reduction in the number of offspring\nborn alive. This effect was more severe at 20 mg/kg (approximate the human clinical\ndose on a mg/m  basis) and was accompanied by high neonatal mortality soon after\nparturition. In rabbits, a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (240 mg/m , about twice the\nrecommended dose in humans on a mg/m  basis) caused reduced fetal weight.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nIt is not known whether IRESSA is excreted in human milk. Animal studies indicate the\ngefitinib and its metabolites are present in rat milk at a concentration higher than those\nin maternal plasma. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing\ninfants from IRESSA, advise women to discontinue breast-feeding during treatment with\nIRESSA.\nData\nAnimal Data\nLevels of gefitinib and its metabolites were 11-to-19-fold higher in milk than in blood,\nafter oral exposure of lactating rats to a dose of 5 mg/kg.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nContraception\nBased on its mechanism of action and animal data, IRESSA can cause fetal harm when\nadministered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise\nfemales of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with\nIRESSA and for at least two weeks following completion of therapy.\nInfertility\nIRESSA may result in reduced fertility in females of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical\nToxicology (13.1)].\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of IRESSA in pediatric patients have not been established.\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the 823 patients enrolled in two randomized, active-controlled clinical trials 374\npatients (45%) were 65 years and older, and 93 patients (11%) were 75 years and older.\nNo overall differences in safety were observed between patients 65 years and older and\nthose younger than 65 years. There is insufficient information to assess for differences\nin efficacy between older and younger patients.\n8.6 Renal Impairment\nLess than four percent (<4%) of gefitinib and its metabolites are excreted via the kidney.\nNo clinical studies were conducted with IRESSA in patients with severe renal impairment.\n8.7 Hepatic Impairment\nThe systemic exposure of gefitinib was compared in patients with mild, moderate, or\nsevere hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis (according to Child-Pugh classification) and\nhealthy subjects with normal hepatic function (N=10/group). The mean systemic\nexposure (AUC\n) was increased by 40% in patients with mild impairment, 263% in\npatients with moderate impairment, and 166% in patients with severe hepatic\nimpairment. Monitor adverse reactions when IRESSA is administered to patients with\nmoderate and severe hepatic impairment.\nIn a study comparing 13 patients with liver metastases and moderate hepatic\nimpairment (addition of CTC grade of baseline AST/SGOT, ALP, and bilirubin equals 3 to\n5) to 14 patients with liver metastases and normal hepatic function, the systemic\nexposure of gefitinib was similar [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].\n10 OVERDOSAGE\nTwenty three patients were treated weekly with doses from 1500 mg to 3500 mg, and\nIRESSA exposure did not increase with increasing dose. Adverse events were mostly\nmild to moderate in severity, and were consistent with the known safety profile of\nIRESSA. In the event of suspected overdose, interrupt IRESSA, institute supportive care,\nand observe until clinical stabilization. There are no specific measures/treatments that\nshould be taken following IRESSA overdosing.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nGefitinib is a kinase inhibitor.\nThe chemical name of gefitinib is 4-Quinazolinamine N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-7-\nmethoxy-6-[3-(4-morpholinyl) propoxy] and the following structural formula:\n0-\u221e\nGefitinib has the molecular formula C\nH\nClFN O , a relative molecular mass of 446.9\ndaltons and is a white-colored powder. Gefitinib is a free base. The molecule has pK s of\n5.4 and 7.2. Gefitinib can be defined as sparingly soluble at pH 1, but is practically\ninsoluble above pH 7, with the solubility decreasing sharply between pH 4 and pH 6. In\nnon-aqueous solvents, gefitinib is freely soluble in glacial acetic acid and dimethyl\nsulfoxide, soluble in pyridine, sparingly soluble in tetrahydrofuran, and slightly soluble in\nmethanol, ethanol (99.5%), ethyl acetate, propan-2-ol and acetonitrile.\nIRESSA\n (gefitinib) tablets are available as brown film-coated tablets, containing 250 mg\nof gefitinib, for oral administration. The inactive ingredients of the tablet core of IRESSA\ntablets are lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium,\npovidone, sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate. The tablet coating is composed\nof hypromellose, polyethylene glycol 300, titanium dioxide, red ferric oxide and yellow\nferric oxide.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is expressed on the cell surface of both\nnormal and cancer cells and plays a role in the processes of cell growth and\nproliferation. Some EGFR activating mutations (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 point\nmutation L858R) within NSCLC cells have been identified as contributing to the\npromotion of tumor cell growth, blocking of apoptosis, increasing the production of\nangiogenic factors and facilitating the processes of metastasis.\nGefitinib reversibly inhibits the kinase activity of wild-type and certain activating\nmutations of EGFR, preventing autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues associated with\nthe receptor, thereby inhibiting further downstream signaling and blocking EGFR-\ndependent proliferation.\nGefitinib binding affinity for EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 point mutation L858R\nmutations is higher than its affinity for the wild-type EGFR. Gefitinib also inhibits IGF and\nPDGF-mediated signaling at clinically relevant concentrations; inhibition of other tyrosine\nkinase receptors has not been fully characterized. \n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nAbsorption and Distribution\nThe mean oral bioavailability of gefitinib is 60%, with peak plasma levels occurring 3-7\n22\n24\n4\n3\na\n\u00ae\nhours after dosing. Food does not alter gefitinib bioavailability to a clinically meaningful\nextent. IRESSA can be administered with or without food. Gefitinib is extensively\ndistributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 1400\nL following intravenous administration. In vitro binding of gefitinib to human plasma\nproteins (serum albumin and \u03b11-acid glycoprotein) is 90%, independent of drug\nconcentrations. Gefitinib is a substrate for the membrane transport P-glycoprotein (P-\ngp), but it is unlikely to influence gefitinib absorption as P-gp is saturated at higher\nconcentrations.\nMetabolism and Elimination\nGefitinib undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism in humans, predominantly by CYP3A4.\nThree sites of biotransformation have been identified: metabolism of the N-\npropoxymorpholino-group, demethylation of the methoxy-substituent on the\nquinazoline, and oxidative defluorination of the halogenated phenyl group. Five\nmetabolites have been fully identified in fecal extracts and the major active component\nwas O-desmethyl gefitinib produced by CYP2D6 metabolism and accounted for 14% of\nthe dose.\nEight metabolites were identified in human plasma. Only O-desmethyl gefitinib has\nexposure comparable to gefitinib. Although this metabolite has similar EGFR-TK activity\nto gefitinib in the isolated enzyme assay, it had only 1/14 of the potency of gefitinib in\none of the cell-based assays.\nGefitinib is cleared primarily by the liver, with total plasma clearance and elimination half-\nlife of 48 hours after intravenous administration. The inter-subject variability (coefficient\nof variation) for AUC in healthy subjects was 67%. Daily oral administration of gefitinib to\ncancer patients resulted in a two-fold accumulation compared to single dose\nadministration. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within 10 days after\ndaily dosing. Excretion of gefitinib and its metabolites is predominantly via the feces\n(86%), with renal elimination accounting for less than 4% of the administered dose.\nSpecific Populations\nAge, gender, body weight, ethnicity or renal function: Population pharmacokinetic\nanalyses suggest that patient age, body weight, ethnicity (populations included) or\ncreatinine clearance (above 20 mL/min) has no clinically meaningful effect on predicted\nsteady state trough concentration of gefitinib. Population pharmacokinetic analyses of\nStudy 1 showed that women had 27% higher exposure than men; however, this\ndifference was not identified in the analyses of other gefitinib clinical studies. No dose\nadjustment based on patient gender is recommended.\nHepatic Impairment: The systemic exposure of gefitinib was compared between patients\nwith mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis (according to Child-\nPugh classification) and healthy subjects with normal hepatic function (N=10/group).\nThe mean systemic exposure (AUC0-\u221e) was increased by 40% in patients with mild\nimpairment, 263% in patients with moderate impairment, and 166% in patients with\nsevere hepatic impairment. In a study comparing 13 patients with liver metastases and\nmoderate hepatic impairment to 14 patients with liver metastases and normal hepatic\nfunction, the systemic exposure of gefitinib was similar [see Warnings and Precautions\n(5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].\nCYP2D6 Poor metabolizer: CYP2D6 metabolizes gefitinib to O-desmethyl gefitinib in vitro.\nIn healthy CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, O-desmethyl gefitinib concentration was not\nmeasurable and the mean exposure to gefitinib was 2-fold higher as compared to the\nextensive metabolizers. This increase in exposure in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers may be\nclinically important because some adverse drug reactions are related to higher exposure\nof gefitinib. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with a known CYP2D6 poor\nmetabolizer genotype, but these patients should be closely monitored for adverse\nreactions. The impact of CYP2D6 inhibiting drugs on gefitinib pharmacokinetics has not\nbeen evaluated. However, similar precautions should be used when administering\nCYP2D6 inhibitors with IRESSA because of the possibility of increased exposure in these\npatients.\nAn exploratory exposure response analysis showed an increase in the incidence of\ninterstitial lung disease (ILD) with a greater than 2-fold increase in the gefitinib exposure\n[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\nDrug-Drug Interactions\nStrong CYP3A4 Inducer:\nConcomitant administration of rifampicin (600 mg QD for 16 days), a strong inducer of\nCYP3A4, with gefitinib (500 mg single dose on Day 10 of gefitinib administration)\nreduced mean AUC of gefitinib by 83% [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Drug\nInteractions (7)].\nCYP3A4 Inhibitor:\nConcomitant administration of itraconazole (200 mg QD for 12 days), an inhibitor of\nCYP3A4, with gefitinib (250 mg single dose on Day 4 of itraconazole administration) to\nhealthy male subjects, increased mean gefitinib AUC by 80% [see Drug Interactions (7)].\nDrugs Affecting Gastric pH:\nCo-administration of high doses of ranitidine with sodium bicarbonate (to maintain the\ngastric pH above pH 5.0) to healthy subjects decreased mean gefitinib AUC by 47% [see\nDrug Interactions (7)].\nIn human liver microsome studies, gefitinib had no inhibitory effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9,\nand CYP3A4 activities at concentrations ranging from 2-5000 ng/mL. At the highest\nconcentration studied (5000 ng/mL), gefitinib inhibited CYP2C19 by 24% and CYP2D6 by\n43%.\nExposure to metoprolol, a substrate of CYP2D6, was increased by 30% when it was\ngiven on Day 15 of gefitinib dosing (500 mg daily for 28 days) in patients with solid\ntumors.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nGefitinib has been tested for genotoxicity in a series of in vitro (bacterial mutation,\nmouse lymphoma, and human lymphocyte) assays and an in vivo rat micronucleus test.\nUnder the conditions of these assays, gefitinib did not cause genetic damage.\nIn a two-year carcinogenicity study in mice, administration of gefitinib at a dose of 270\nmg/m /day (approximately twice the recommended daily dose of 250 mg on a mg/m\nbasis; dose reduced from 375 mg/m /day from week 22) caused hepatocellular\n2\n2\n2\nadenomas in females. In a two-year carcinogenicity study in rats, administration of\ngefitinib at 60 mg/m /day (approximately 0.4 times the recommended daily clinical dose\non a mg/m  basis) caused hepatocellular adenomas and\nhemangiomas/hemagiosarcomas of the mesenteric lymph nodes in female rats. The\nclinical relevance of these findings is unknown.\nIn a dedicated fertility study in rats at doses \u2265120 mg/m  (approximately equal to the\nrecommended human dose of gefitinib on a mg/m  basis), animals presented with an\nincreased incidence of irregular estrous, decreased corpora lutea, and decreases in\nuterine implants and live embryos per litter. \n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)\nStudy 1\nThe efficacy and safety of IRESSA for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic\nNSCLC containing EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R substitution mutations was\ndemonstrated in a multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical study (Study 1). A total of\n106 treatment-naive patients with metastatic EGFR mutation positive NSCLC received\nIRESSA at a dose of 250 mg once daily until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was objective response rate (ORR) according to\nRECIST v1.1 as evaluated by both a Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) and\ninvestigators. Duration of response (DOR) was an additional outcome measure. Eligible\npatients were required to have a deletion in EGFR exon 19 or L858R, L861Q, or G719X\nsubstitution mutation and no T790M or S768I mutation or exon 20 insertion in tumor\nspecimens as prospectively determined by a clinical trial assay. Tumor samples from 87\npatients were tested retrospectively using the therascreen\n EGFR RGQ PCR Kit.\nThe study population characteristics were: median age 65 years, age 75 years or older\n(25%), age less than 65 years (49%), white (100%), female (71%), never smokers\n(64%), WHO PS 0 (45%), WHO PS 1 (48%), WHO PS 2 (7%), and adenocarcinoma\nhistology (97%). Sixty patients had exon 19 deletions (65%), 29 patients had L858R\nsubstitution (31%), while two patients each had tumors harboring L861Q or G719X\nsubstitution mutation.\nThe median duration of treatment was 8.0 months. Efficacy results from Study 1 are\nsummarized below.\nTable 3 \u2013 Efficacy Results in Study 1\n*\nEfficacy Parameter\nBICR  Assessment\n(n=106)\nInvestigator\nAssessment \n(n=106)\nObjective Response Rate\n(95% CI)\n50%\n(41, 59)\n70%\n(61, 78)\nComplete Response Rate\n0.9%\n1.9%\nPartial Response Rate\n49%\n68%\nMedian Duration of Response (months)\n(95% CI)\n6.0\n(5.6, 11.1)\n8.3\n(7.6, 11.3)\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u00ae\nBICR, Blinded Independent Central Review\n17 patients without target lesion at baseline detected by BICR were deemed non responders\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\nThe response rates were similar in patients whose tumors had EGFR exon 19 deletions\nand exon 21 L858R substitution mutations. Two partial responses were observed in\nboth patients whose tumors had G719X substitution mutation with duration of response\nof at least 2.8 months and 5.6 months, respectively. One of two patients whose tumors\nhad L861Q substitution mutation also achieved a partial response with duration of\nresponse of at least 2.8 months.\nStudy 2\nThe results of Study 1 were supported by an exploratory analysis of a subset of a\nrandomized, multicenter, open-label trial (Study 2) conducted in patients with metastatic\nadenocarcinoma histology NSCLC receiving first-line treatment. Patients were\nrandomized (1:1) to receive IRESSA 250 mg orally once daily or up to 6 cycles of\ncarboplatin/paclitaxel. The efficacy outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS)\nand objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by BICR.\nThe subset population consisted of 186 of 1217 patients (15%) determined to be EGFR\npositive by the same clinical trial assay as used in Study 1 and had radiographic scans\navailable for a retrospective assessment by BICR. In this subset, there were 88 IRESSA-\ntreated patients and 98 carboplatin/paclitaxel-treated patients.\nDemographic and baseline characteristics of this subset were a median age of 59 years,\nage 75 years or older (7%), age less than 65 (70%), Asian (100%), female (83%), never\nsmokers (96%), adenocarcinoma histology (100%), and PS 0-1 (94%).\nThe median duration of treatment for IRESSA-treated patients was 9.8 months. The\nhazard ratio for PFS favored the IRESSA-treated patients [HR of 0.54 (95% CI: 0.38,\n0.79)] with a median PFS of 10.9 months for the IRESSA-treated patients and 7.4\nmonths for the carboplatin/paclitaxel-treated patients as assessed by BICR. In addition,\nthe objective response rate was 67% (95% CI: 56, 77) for IRESSA-treated patients and\n41% (95% CI: 31, 51) for carboplatin/paclitaxel-treated patients based on BICR\nassessment.

Twelve of the fifteen\npatients died within 30 days of the last dose of PORTRAZZA and had comorbid\nconditions including history of coronary artery disease (n=3), hypomagnesemia (n=4),\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n=7), and hypertension (n=5). Eleven of the 12\npatients had an unwitnessed death. Patients with significant coronary artery disease,\nmyocardial infarction within 6 months, uncontrolled hypertension, and uncontrolled\ncongestive heart failure were not enrolled in Study 1. The incremental risk of\ncardiopulmonary arrest or sudden death in patients with a history of coronary artery\ndisease, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias as compared to those without these\ncomorbid conditions is not known.\nClosely monitor serum electrolytes, including serum magnesium, potassium, and calcium\nprior to each infusion of PORTRAZZA during treatment and after PORTRAZZA\nadministration for at least 8 weeks after the last dose. Withhold PORTRAZZA for Grade\n3 or 4 electrolyte abnormalities; subsequent cycles of PORTRAZZA may be administered\nin these patients once electrolyte abnormalities have improved to Grade \u22642. Replete\nelectrolytes as medically appropriate [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions\n(5.2)].\n5.2 Hypomagnesemia\nHypomagnesemia occurred in 83% of 461/538 patients with available laboratory results\ntreated with PORTRAZZA as compared to 70% of 457/541 patients with available\nlaboratory results treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone in Study 1.\nHypomagnesemia was severe (Grade 3 or 4) in 20% of the patients treated with\nPORTRAZZA compared to 7% of the patients treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin\nalone. The median time to development of hypomagnesemia and accompanying\nth\nth\nelectrolyte abnormalities was 6 weeks (25\n percentile 4 weeks; 75\n percentile 9 weeks)\nafter initiation of PORTRAZZA. Monitor patients for hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and\nhypokalemia prior to each infusion of PORTRAZZA during treatment and for at least 8\nweeks following the completion of PORTRAZZA. Withhold PORTRAZZA for Grade 3 or 4\nelectrolyte abnormalities; subsequent cycles of PORTRAZZA may be administered in\nthese patients once hypomagnesemia and related electrolyte abnormalities have\nimproved to Grade \u22642. Replete electrolytes as medically appropriate [see Boxed\nWarning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n5.3 Venous and Arterial Thromboembolic Events\nVenous and arterial thromboembolic events (VTE and ATE), some fatal, were observed\nwith PORTRAZZA in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. In Study 1, the\nincidence of VTE was 9% in patients receiving PORTRAZZA plus gemcitabine and\ncisplatin versus 5% in patients receiving gemcitabine and cisplatin alone and the\nincidence of Grade 3 or higher VTE was 5% versus 3%, respectively. The incidence of\nfatal VTEs was similar between arms (0.2% versus 0.2%). The most common VTEs were\npulmonary embolism (5%) and deep-vein thrombosis (2%).\nThe incidence of ATEs of any grade was 5% versus 4% and the incidence of Grade 3 or\nhigher ATE was 4% versus 2% in the PORTRAZZA containing and gemcitabine and\ncisplatin arms, respectively, in Study 1. The most common ATEs were cerebral stroke\nand ischemia (2%) and myocardial infarction (1%).\nIn an exploratory analysis of Study 1, the relative risk of VTE or ATE was approximately\n3-fold higher in patients with a reported history of VTE or ATE than in patients with no\nreported history of VTE or ATE.\nDiscontinue PORTRAZZA for patients with serious or life threatening VTE or ATE.\n5.4 Dermatologic Toxicities\nDermatologic toxicities, including rash, dermatitis acneiform, acne, dry skin, pruritus,\ngeneralized rash, skin fissures, maculo-papular rash and erythema, occurred in 79% of\npatients receiving PORTRAZZA in Study 1. Skin toxicity was severe in 8% of patients.\nSkin toxicity usually developed within the first 2 weeks of therapy and resolved within 17\nweeks after onset. For Grade 3 skin reactions, modify the dose of PORTRAZZA [see\nDosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Limit sun exposure [see\nPatient Counseling Information (17)].\nDiscontinue PORTRAZZA for severe (Grade 4) skin reactions, or for Grade 3 skin\ninduration/fibrosis.\n5.5 Infusion-Related Reactions\nIn Study 1, 1.5% of PORTRAZZA treated patients experienced IRRs of any severity with\n0.4% Grade 3 IRR. No patients received premedication for IRR for the first dose of\nPORTRAZZA in Study 1. Most IRRs occurred after the first or second administration of\nPORTRAZZA. Monitor patients during and following PORTRAZZA infusion for signs and\nsymptoms of IRR. Discontinue PORTRAZZA for serious or life-threatening IRR [see\nDosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n5.6 Non-Squamous NSCLC - Increased Toxicity and Increased Mortality\nth\nth\nPORTRAZZA is not indicated for the treatment of patients with non-squamous NSCLC.\nIn a study of PORTRAZZA plus pemetrexed and cisplatin (PC) versus PC alone (Study 2),\npatients treated with PORTRAZZA and PC experienced more serious (51% versus 41%)\nand fatal toxicities (16% versus 10%) and cardiopulmonary arrest/sudden death within\n30 days of the last study drug (3.3% versus 1.3%) compared to patients who received\nPC alone [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].\n5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on animal data and its mechanism of action, PORTRAZZA can cause fetal harm\nwhen administered to a pregnant woman. Disruption or depletion of EGFR in animal\nmodels results in impairment of embryofetal development including effects on placental,\nlung, cardiac, skin, and neural development. The absence of EGFR signaling has resulted\nin embryolethality as well as post-natal death in animals. Advise pregnant women of the\npotential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective\ncontraception during treatment with PORTRAZZA and for three months following the\nfinal dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse drug reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of\nthe label:\nCardiopulmonary Arrest [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\nHypomagnesemia [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].\nVenous and Arterial Thromboembolic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].\nDermatologic Toxicities [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and\nPrecautions (5.4)].\nInfusion-Related Reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3) and Warnings\nand Precautions (5.5)].\nNon-Squamous NSCLC - Increased Toxicity and Increased Mortality [see Warnings\nand Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe safety of PORTRAZZA was evaluated in two randomized, open-label trials comparing\nPORTRAZZA plus gemcitabine and cisplatin to gemcitabine and cisplatin alone in patients\nwith squamous NSCLC (Study 1), and PORTRAZZA plus pemetrexed and cisplatin to\npemetrexed and cisplatin alone in patients with non-squamous NSCLC (Study 2). Since\nthe data in Study 2 demonstrated similar incidence of adverse reactions over control as\nobserved in Study 1, the safety data from Study 1 alone is described below.\nFor patients who received at least 1 dose of treatment in Study 1, the median age was\n62 years (range 32 to 84), 83% were male; 84% were Caucasian; and 92% were\nsmokers. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 or 1 for 91%, and 2 for 9% of\npatients; 90% had metastatic disease in 2 or more sites. Patients received PORTRAZZA\n800 mg intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each 21 day cycle in combination with up to\nsix cycles of gemcitabine (1250 mg/m  on days 1 and 8) and cisplatin (75 mg/m  on day\n2\n2\n1). Patients received PORTRAZZA until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.\nPatients in the gemcitabine and cisplatin alone arm received a maximum of 6 cycles,\nwhile patients in the PORTRAZZA plus gemcitabine and cisplatin arm demonstrating at\nleast stable disease were permitted to continue to receive additional cycles of\nPORTRAZZA until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of\nexposure to PORTRAZZA in 538 patients who received at least 1 dose of treatment in\nStudy 1 was 4.6 months (range 0.5 months to 34 months), including 182 patients\nexposed for at least 6 months and 41 patients exposed for greater than 1 year. Patients\nwere monitored for safety until 30 days after treatment discontinuation and resolution\nof treatment-emergent adverse events.\nThe most common adverse reactions (all grades) observed in PORTRAZZA-treated\npatients at a rate of \u226515% and \u22652% higher than gemcitabine and cisplatin alone were\nrash (44%), vomiting (29%), diarrhea (16%), and dermatitis acneiform (15%). The most\ncommon severe (Grade 3 or higher) adverse events that occurred at a \u22652% higher rate\nin PORTRAZZA-treated patients compared to patients treated with gemcitabine and\ncisplatin alone were venous thromboembolic events (5%; including pulmonary\nembolism), rash (4%), and vomiting (3%).\nTable 1 contains selected adverse drug reactions observed in Study 1 at an incidence of\n\u22655% in the PORTRAZZA arm and at \u22652% higher incidence than the control arm.\nTable 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring at Incidence Rate \u22655% All Grades or a\n\u22652% Grade 3-4 Difference Between Arms in Patients Receiving PORTRAZZA\nin Study 1\nAdverse Reactions (MedDRA) \nSystem Organ Class\nPORTRAZZA PLUS\nGEMCITABINE AND\nCISPLATIN \nN=538 (%)\nGEMCITABINE AND\nCISPLATIN \nN=541 (%)\nAll Grades \n(Frequency\n%)\nGrade 3-4 \n(Frequency\n%)\nAll Grades \n(Frequency\n%)\nGrade 3-4 \n(Frequency\n%)\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue\nDisorders\n    Rash\n44\n4\n6\n0.2\n    Dermatitis Acneiform\n15\n1\n0.6\n0\n    Acne\n9\n0.4\n0.6\n0\n    Pruritus\n7\n0.2\n0.9\n0.2\n    Dry Skin\n7\n0\n1\n0\n    Skin fissures\n5\n0.4\n0\n0\nGastrointestinal Disorders\n    Vomiting\n29\n3\n25\n0.9\n    Diarrhea\n16\n2\n11\n1\n    Stomatitis\n11\n1\n6\n0.6\nInvestigations\n    Weight decreased\n13\n0.7\n6\n0.6\nRespiratory, Thoracic and\nMediastinal Disorders\n Pulmonary embolism is also included in the composite term venous thromboembolic events under\nsystem organ class vascular disorders.\n VTE is a composite term which includes: pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, thrombosis,\nmesenteric veins thrombosis, pulmonary artery thrombosis, pulmonary venous thrombosis,\nvenous thrombosis limb, axillary vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, thrombosis in device, vena\ncava thrombosis, venous thrombosis, subclavian vein thrombosis, superior vena cava syndrome,\nand thrombophlebitis superficial.\n Conjunctivitis is a composite term that includes conjunctivitis, eye irritation, vision blurred,\nconjunctivitis bacterial, dry eye, visual acuity reduced, blepharitis, allergic blepharitis, conjunctiva\nhemorrhage, eye infection, eye pain, lacrimation increased, ocular hyperemia, Sjogren's\nsyndrome, visual impairment, and eye pruritus.\n    Hemoptysis\n10\n1\n5\n0.9\n    Pulmonary embolism\n5\n4\n2\n2\nNervous System Disorders\n    Headache\n11\n0\n6\n0.4\nVascular Disorders\n    Venous Thromboembolic Events\n(VTE)\n9\n5\n5\n3\nInfections and Infestations\n    Paronychia\n7\n0.4\n0.2\n0\nEye Disorders\n    Conjunctivitis\n7\n0.4\n2\n0\nClinically relevant adverse reactions (all grades) reported in \u22651% and <5% of patients\ntreated with PORTRAZZA were: dysphagia (3%), oropharyngeal pain (1%), muscle\nspasms (2%), phlebitis (2%), and hypersensitivity/IRR (1.5%).\nIn Study 1, 12% of the patients on the PORTRAZZA arm discontinued study treatment\ndue to an adverse reaction. The most common PORTRAZZA related toxicity leading to\nPORTRAZZA discontinuation was skin rash (1%).\nTable 2 contains selected electrolyte abnormalities observed in Study 1 according to\nlaboratory assessment at an incidence of >10% in the PORTRAZZA arm and at >2%\nhigher incidence than the control arm.\nThe median time to onset of hypomagnesemia was 6 weeks (25\n percentile 4 weeks;\n75\n percentile 9 weeks). Hypomagnesemia was reported as resolved in 43% of the\npatients who received PORTRAZZA. In Study 1, 32% of the patients in the PORTRAZZA\narm and 16% of the patients who received gemcitabine and cisplatin alone received\nmagnesium replacement.\nTable 2: Electrolyte Abnormalities according to Laboratory Assessment at\nIncidence Rate >10% and a >2% Difference between Arms in Patients\nReceiving PORTRAZZA in Study 1\nLABORATORY\nPARAMETER\nPORTRAZZA PLUS\nGEMCITABINE AND CISPLATIN\nN=538\nGEMCITABINE AND CISPLATIN\nN=541\nN  \nAll Grades \n(Frequency\n%)\nGrade 3 or\n4 \n(Frequency\nN  \nAll Grades \n(Frequency\n%)\nGrade 3 or\n4 \n(Frequency\na\nb\nc\na\nb\nc\nth\nth\na\na\na\n Only patients with baseline and at least one post-baseline result are included.\n%)\n%)\nHypomagnesemia\n461\n83\n20\n457\n70\n7\nHypokalemia\n505\n28\n5\n505\n18\n3\nHypocalcemia\n502\n45\n6\n499\n30\n2\nHypocalcemia\n(albumin\ncorrected)\n477\n36\n4\n480\n23\n2\nHypophosphatemia 462\n31\n8\n454\n23\n6\n6.2 Immunogenicity\nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity. In clinical trials,\ntreatment-emergent anti-necitumumab antibodies (ADA) were detected in 4.1% (33/814)\nof patients using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Neutralizing\nantibodies were detected in 1.4% (11/814) of patients post exposure to PORTRAZZA.\nNo relationship was found between the presence of ADA and incidence of infusion-\nrelated reactions. The impact of ADA on efficacy (overall survival) could not be assessed\ndue to the limited number of patients with treatment-emergent ADA. In Study 1, the\nexposure to necitumumab was lower in patients with ADA post-treatment than in\npatients without detectable ADA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nThe detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity\nof the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing\nantibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay\nmethodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications,\nand underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to\nPORTRAZZA with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading.\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on animal data and its mechanism of action, PORTRAZZA can cause fetal harm\nwhen administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Disruption\nor depletion of EGFR in animal models results in impairment of embryo-fetal development\nincluding effects on placental, lung, cardiac, skin, and neural development. The absence\nof EGFR signaling has resulted in embryolethality as well as post-natal death in animals\n(see Data). No animal reproduction studies have been conducted with necitumumab.\nThere are no available data for PORTRAZZA exposure in pregnant women. Advise\npregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus, and the risk to postnatal development.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nNo animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of necitumumab on\na\nreproduction and fetal development; however, based on its mechanism of action,\nPORTRAZZA can cause fetal harm or developmental anomalies. In mice, EGFR is critically\nimportant in reproductive and developmental processes including blastocyst\nimplantation, placental development, and embryo-fetal/postnatal survival and\ndevelopment. Reduction or elimination of embryo-fetal or maternal EGFR signaling can\nprevent implantation, can cause embryo-fetal loss during various stages of gestation\n(through effects on placental development) and can cause developmental anomalies and\nearly death in surviving fetuses. Adverse developmental outcomes were observed in\nmultiple organs in embryos/neonates of mice with disrupted EGFR signaling. Human\nIgG1 is known to cross the placenta; therefore, necitumumab has the potential to be\ntransmitted from the mother to the developing fetus.\nIn monkeys, administration of a chimeric anti-EGFR antibody that binds to an epitope\noverlapping that of necitumumab during the period of organogenesis resulted in\ndetectable exposure of the antibody in the amniotic fluid and in the serum of embryos\nfrom treated dams. While no fetal malformations or other clear teratogenic effects\noccurred in offspring, there was an increased incidence of embryolethality and\nabortions.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere is no information regarding the presence of necitumumab in human milk, the\neffects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the\npotential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from PORTRAZZA, advise a\nnursing woman not to breastfeed during treatment with PORTRAZZA and for three\nmonths following the final dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nContraception\nFemales\nBased on its mechanism of action, PORTRAZZA can cause fetal harm when\nadministered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise\nfemales of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with\nPORTRAZZA and for three months following the final dose.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of PORTRAZZA have not been established in pediatric\npatients.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the 545 patients in the PORTRAZZA plus gemcitabine and cisplatin arm in Study 1,\n213 (39%) were 65 years and over, while 108 (20%) were 70 years and over. In an\nexploratory subgroup analysis of Study 1, the hazard ratio for overall survival in patients\n70 years or older was 1.03 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.42). Of the adverse reactions listed in Table\n1 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], there was a higher incidence (\u22653%) of venous\nthromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism in patients age 70 and over\ncompared to those who were younger than age 70.\n8.6 Renal Impairment\nNo formal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on\nthe exposure to necitumumab. Renal function has no influence on the exposure to\nnecitumumab based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from clinical\ntrials [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n8.7 Hepatic Impairment\nNo formal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on\nthe exposure to necitumumab. Mild or moderate hepatic impairment has no influence on\nthe exposure to necitumumab based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. No\npatients with severe hepatic impairment were enrolled in the clinical trials with\nPORTRAZZA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n10 OVERDOSAGE\nThere has been limited experience with PORTRAZZA overdose in human clinical trials.\nThe highest dose of PORTRAZZA studied clinically in a human dose-escalation Phase 1\nstudy was 1000 mg once a week and once every other week. Two out of 9 patients in\nthe every other week cohort experienced dose-limiting toxicities (e.g., a combination of\nGrade 3 headache, vomiting, and nausea). There is no known antidote for PORTRAZZA\noverdose.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nNecitumumab is an anti-EGFR recombinant human monoclonal antibody of the IgG1\nkappa isotype that specifically binds to the ligand binding site of the human EGFR.\nNecitumumab has an approximate molecular weight of 144.8 kDa. Necitumumab is\nproduced in genetically engineered mammalian NS0 cells.\nPORTRAZZA is a sterile, preservative free, clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to\nslightly yellow solution. PORTRAZZA is available in single-dose vials for intravenous\ninfusion following dilution. Each vial contains 800 mg PORTRAZZA in 50 mL (16 mg/mL).\nEach mL contains necitumumab (16 mg), citric acid anhydrous (0.256 mg), glycine\n(9.984 mg), mannitol (9.109 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.1 mg), sodium chloride (2.338 mg),\nsodium citrate dihydrate (2.55 mg), and water for injection, pH 6.0.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nNecitumumab is a recombinant human lgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to the\nhuman epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and blocks the binding of EGFR to its\nligands. Expression and activation of EGFR has been correlated with malignant\nprogression, induction of angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis. Binding of\nnecitumumab induces EGFR internalization and degradation in vitro. In vitro, binding of\nnecitumumab also led to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in EGFR-\nexpressing cells.\nIn in vivo studies using xenograft models of human cancer, including non-small cell lung\ncarcinoma, administration of necitumumab to implanted mice resulted in increased\nantitumor activity in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin as compared to mice\nreceiving gemcitabine and cisplatin alone.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nBased on population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analysis of serum concentration data\nfrom patients in clinical studies with PORTRAZZA, necitumumab exhibits dose-\ndependent kinetics. Following the administration of PORTRAZZA 800 mg on Days 1 and\n8 of each 21 day cycle, the estimated mean total systemic clearance (CL\n) at steady\nstate is 14.1 mL/h (CV=39%), the steady state volume of distribution (V\n) is 7.0 L\n(CV=31%) and the elimination half-life is approximately 14 days. The predicted time to\nreach steady state is approximately 100 days.\nSpecific Populations\nEffect of Age, Body Weight, Sex and Race:\nBased on the popPK analysis with data obtained in 807 patients, age (range 19-84\nyears), sex (75% males), and race (85% Whites) have no effect on the systemic\nexposure of necitumumab.\nBody weight is identified as a covariate in the popPK analysis; however, weight-based\ndosing is not expected to significantly decrease the variability in exposure. No dose\nadjustment based on body weight is necessary.\nRenal Impairment\nPatients with Renal Impairment \u2014 PopPK analysis did not identify a correlation between\nnecitumumab exposure and renal function as assessed by estimated creatinine\nclearance ranging from 11-250 mL/min.\nHepatic Impairment\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment \u2014 PopPK analysis did not identify a correlation between\nthe exposure of necitumumab and hepatic function as assessed by alanine\naminotransferase (ranging from 2-615 U/L), aspartate transaminase (ranging from 1.2-\n619 U/L) and total bilirubin (ranging from 0.1-106 \u03bcmol/L).\nDrug Interactions\nEffect of Necitumumab on Gemcitabine and Cisplatin\nIn 12 patients with advanced solid tumors who received gemcitabine and cisplatin in\ncombination with PORTRAZZA, the geometric mean dose-normalized AUC of\ngemcitabine was increased by 22% and C\n increased by 63% compared to\nadministration of gemcitabine and cisplatin alone while exposure to cisplatin was\nunchanged.\nEffect of Gemcitabine and Cisplatin on Necitumumab\nConcomitant administration of gemcitabine and cisplatin had no effect on the exposure\nof necitumumab.\nImmunogenicity\ntot\nss\nmax\nIn Study 1, the CL\n of necitumumab was 26% higher and C\n was 34% lower in\npatients who tested positive for anti-necitumumab antibodies (ADA) post-treatment than\npatients who tested negative for ADA post-treatment.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nNo studies have been performed to assess the potential of necitumumab for\ncarcinogenicity or genotoxicity.\nFertility studies have not been performed with necitumumab.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\nStudy 1 was a randomized, multi-center open-label, controlled trial conducted in 1093\npatients receiving gemcitabine and cisplatin first-line chemotherapy for metastatic\nsquamous NSCLC. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive PORTRAZZA plus\ngemcitabine and cisplatin or gemcitabine and cisplatin alone. Stratification factors were\nECOG performance status (0, 1 versus 2) and geographic region (North America,\nEurope, and Australia versus South America, South Africa, and India versus Eastern\nAsia). Gemcitabine (1250 mg/m , Days 1 and 8) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m , Day 1) were\nadministered every 3 weeks (1 cycle) for a maximum of 6 cycles in the absence of\ndisease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PORTRAZZA (800 mg by intravenous\ninfusion on Days 1 and 8 of each 3-week cycle) was administered prior to gemcitabine\nand cisplatin. Patients demonstrating at least stable disease on PORTRAZZA plus\ngemcitabine and cisplatin were to continue PORTRAZZA as a single agent in the absence\nof disease progression or unacceptable toxicity after completion of 6 planned courses\nof chemotherapy or if chemotherapy was discontinued for toxicity.\nOf the 1093 randomized patients, the median age was 62 years (range 32 to 86), 83%\nwere male; 84% were Caucasian; and 91% were smokers. The majority of the patients\n(87%) were enrolled in North America, Europe and Australia, 36 patients (3%) were\nenrolled at clinical sites in the U.S., 6% of the patients were enrolled in South America,\nSouth Africa and India and 8% enrolled at clinical sites in Eastern Asia. Baseline ECOG\nperformance status was 0 or 1 for 91%, and 2 for 9% of patients; 91% had metastatic\ndisease in 2 or more sites. In the PORTRAZZA plus gemcitabine and cisplatin arm, 51%\nof patients continued PORTRAZZA after completion or discontinuation of chemotherapy.\nUse of post-study systemic therapy was 47% in the PORTRAZZA plus gemcitabine and\ncisplatin arm, and 45% in the gemcitabine and cisplatin arm.\nThe main outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Investigator-assessed\nprogression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) were also assessed.\nOverall survival and PFS were statistically significantly improved in patients randomized\nto receive PORTRAZZA plus gemcitabine and cisplatin compared to gemcitabine and\ncisplatin alone. There was no difference in ORR between arms, with an ORR of 31%\n(95% CI 27, 35) for PORTRAZZA plus gemcitabine and cisplatin arm and an ORR of 29%\n(95% CI 25, 33) for gemcitabine and cisplatin arm, p-value 0.40.\ntot\nss,ave\n2\n2\nEfficacy results are shown in Table 3 and Figure 1.\nTable 3: Efficacy Results for Metastatic Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung\nCancer\n Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval\n Investigator assessed\nPORTRAZZA PLUS\nGEMCITABINE AND\nCISPLATIN \nN=545\nGEMCITABINE AND\nCISPLATIN \nN=548\nOverall Survival\n    Number of deaths (%)\n418 (77%)\n442 (81%)\n    Median \u2013 months (95%\nCI)\n11.5 (10.4, 12.6)\n9.9 (8.9, 11.1)\n    Stratified Hazard Ratio\n(95% CI)\n0.84 (0.74, 0.96)\n    Stratified Log-rank p-value\n0.01\nProgression-Free Survival\n    Number of events (%)\n431 (79%)\n417 (76%)\n    Median \u2013 months (95% CI)\n5.7 (5.6, 6.0)\n5.5 (4.8, 5.6)\n    Stratified Hazard Ratio\n(95% CI)\n0.85 (0.74, 0.98)\n    Stratified Log-rank p-value\n0.02\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier Curves of Overall Survival in Patients with Metastatic\nSquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\na\nb\na\nb\n14.2 Non-Squamous NSCLC - Lack of Efficacy\nLack of efficacy of PORTRAZZA in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin for the\ntreatment of patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer was\ndetermined in one randomized, open-label, multicenter trial (Study 2). The study was\nclosed prematurely after 633 patients were enrolled due to increased incidence of death\ndue to any cause and of thromboembolic events in the PORTRAZZA arm. Patients with\nno prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomized (1:1) to receive\nPORTRAZZA plus pemetrexed and cisplatin or pemetrexed and cisplatin alone.\nStratification factors were smoking status (non-smokers versus light smokers versus\nsmokers), ECOG performance status (0 - 1 versus 2), histology (adenocarcinoma/large\ncell versus others), and geographic region. PORTRAZZA (800 mg, Days 1 and 8 of each\n3-week cycle) was administered prior to pemetrexed and cisplatin. Patients\ndemonstrating at least stable disease on PORTRAZZA plus pemetrexed and cisplatin\nwere to continue PORTRAZZA as a single agent in the absence of disease progression\nor unacceptable toxicity after completion of 6 planned courses of chemotherapy.\nOf the 633 patients, 315 were randomized to PORTRAZZA plus pemetrexed and\ncisplatin arm and 318 in the pemetrexed and cisplatin arm. The median age was 61\nyears, 67 % were male, 93% were Caucasian and 94% had ECOG PS 0 or 1. More than\n75% were smokers and 89% had adenocarcinoma histology.\nThe main efficacy outcome was OS. Progression-free survival and ORR were also\nassessed. Addition of PORTRAZZA to pemetrexed and cisplatin did not improve OS\n[HR=1.01; 95%CI (0.84, 1.21); p-value = 0.96)]; PFS [HR=0.96; 95% CI (0.8, 1.16)] or\nORR (31% in the PORTRAZZA plus pemetrexed and cisplatin arm and 32% in the\npemetrexed and cisplatin alone arm).\n16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING\n16.1 How Supplied\nPORTRAZZA is supplied in single-dose vials as a sterile, preservative-free solution:\n800 mg/50 mL (16 mg/mL)          NDC 0002-7716-01\n16.2 Storage and Handling\nStore vials in a refrigerator at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) until time of use.

Important\nimmune-mediated adverse reactions listed under Warnings and Precautions may not\ninclude all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions.\nThe incidence and severity of immune-mediated adverse reactions were similar when\nIMFINZI was administered as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy or in\ncombination with tremelimumab-actl and platinum-based chemotherapy, unless\notherwise noted.\nImmune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any\norgan system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time\nafter starting treatment with a PD 1/PD L1 blocking antibody. While immune-mediated\nadverse reactions usually manifest during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking\nantibodies, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation\nof PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies.\nEarly identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are\nessential to ensure safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor patients closely\nfor symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-\nmediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at\nbaseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated\nadverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including\ninfection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as\nappropriate.\nWithhold or permanently discontinue IMFINZI depending on severity [see Dosage and\ntremelimumab-actl infusion, infuse IMFINZI over 1 hour. One to two hours after\ncompletion of IMFINZI infusion, administer platinum-based chemotherapy.\nIf there are no infusion reactions during cycle 1, subsequent cycles of IMFINZI can\nbe given immediately after tremelimumab-actl. The time between the end of the\nIMFINZI infusion and the start of chemotherapy can be reduced to 30 minutes.\nAdministration (2.3)]. In general, if IMFINZI requires interruption or discontinuation,\nadminister systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 mg to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or\nequivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less,\ninitiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider\nadministration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-\nmediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.\nToxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require\nsystemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed\nbelow.\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis\nIMFINZI can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is\nhigher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation.\nIMFINZI as a Single Agent\nIn Patients Who Did Not Receive Recent Prior Radiation\nIn patients who received IMFINZI on clinical trials in which radiation therapy was\ngenerally not administered immediately prior to initiation of IMFINZI, the incidence of\nimmune-mediated pneumonitis was 2.4% (34/1414), including fatal (< 0.1%), and Grade\n3-4 (0.4%) adverse reactions. Events resolved in 19 of the 34 patients and resulted in\npermanent discontinuation in 5 patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 19\npatients (19/34) with pneumonitis who did not receive chemoradiation prior to initiation\nof IMFINZI.\nIn Patients Who Received Recent Prior Radiation\nThe incidence of pneumonitis (including radiation pneumonitis) in patients with\nunresectable Stage III NSCLC following definitive chemoradiation within 42 days prior to\ninitiation of IMFINZI in PACIFIC was 18.3% (87/475) in patients receiving IMFINZI and\n12.8% (30/234) in patients receiving placebo. Of the patients who received IMFINZI\n(475) 1.1% were fatal and 2.7% were Grade 3 adverse reactions. Events resolved in 50\nof the 87 patients and resulted in permanent discontinuation in 27 patients.\nSystemic corticosteroids were required in 64 patients (64/87) with pneumonitis who had\nreceived chemoradiation prior to initiation of IMFINZI, while 2 patients required use of\ninfliximab with high-dose steroids.\nThe frequency and severity of immune-mediated pneumonitis in patients who did not\nreceive definitive chemoradiation prior to IMFINZI were similar whether IMFINZI was\ngiven as a single agent in patients with various cancers in a pooled data set or in patients\nwith ES-SCLC or BTC when given in combination with chemotherapy.\nIMFINZI with Tremelimumab-actl\nImmune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 1.3% (5/388) of patients receiving IMFINZI in\ncombination with tremelimumab-actl, including fatal (0.3%) and Grade 3 (0.2%) adverse\nreactions.

For Grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reactions, consider using pre-\nmedications with subsequent doses.\nIMFINZI as a Single Agent\nInfusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (42/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI,\nincluding Grade 3 (0.3%) adverse reactions.\nIMFINZI in Combination with Tremelimumab-actl\nInfusion-related reactions occurred in 10 (2.6%) patients receiving IMFINZI in\ncombination with tremelimumab-actl.\nIMFINZI with Tremelimumab-actl and Platinum-Based Chemotherapy\nInfusion-related reactions occurred in 2.9% (17/596) of patients receiving IMFINZI in\ncombination with tremelimumab-actl, including Grade 3 (0.3%) adverse reactions.\n5.3 Complications of Allogeneic HSCT after IMFINZI\nFatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic\nhematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-\n1/L-1 blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-\nversus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive\ndisease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile\nsyndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur\ndespite intervening therapy between PD-1/L-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT.\nFollow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene\npromptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/L-1 blocking\nantibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.\n5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, IMFINZI can cause fetal\nharm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies,\nadministration of durvalumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis\nthrough delivery resulted in increased premature delivery, fetal loss and premature\nneonatal death. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females\nof reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMFINZI\nand for 3 months after the last dose of IMFINZI [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1,\n8.3)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the\nlabeling.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe data described in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to IMFINZI\nas a single agent in a total of 1,889 patients enrolled in the PACIFIC study (a randomized,\nplacebo-controlled study that enrolled 475 patients with Stage III NSCLC), Study 1108\n(an open-label, single-arm, multicohort study that enrolled 970 patients with advanced\nsolid tumors), and an additional open-label, single arm trial (ATLANTIC Study) that\nenrolled 444 patients with advanced solid tumors, including NSCLC. In these trials,\nIMFINZI was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Among the 1889\npatients, 38% were exposed for 6 months or more and 18% were exposed for 12\nmonths or more. The data also reflect exposure to IMFINZI in combination with\nchemotherapy in 265 patients from the CASPIAN study (a randomized, open-label study\nin patients with ES-SCLC), in 338 patients from the TOPAZ 1 study (a randomized,\ndouble-blind study in patients with BTC). In the CASPIAN and TOPAZ 1 studies, IMFINZI\nwas administered at a dose of 1,500 mg every 3 or 4 weeks.\nThe data also reflect exposure to IMFINZI 1,120 mg in combination with carboplatin and\npaclitaxel (every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles) followed by IMFINZI 1,500 mg (every 4\nweeks) as a single agent in 235 patients in DUO-E (a randomized, placebo-controlled trial\nin endometrial cancer). Among the 235 patients, 77% (181 patients) were exposed to\nIMFINZI for 6 months or more and 41% (96 patients) for 12 months or more.\nThe data also reflect exposure to IMFINZI 1,500 mg in combination with tremelimumab-\nactl 300 mg in 388 patients in HIMALAYA. In the HIMALAYA study patients received\nIMFINZI 1,500 mg in combination with tremelimumab-actl as a single intravenous\ninfusion of 300 mg, followed by IMFINZI 1,500 mg every 4 weeks. The pooled safety\nImmune-Mediated Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\nInfusion-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].\npopulation (N = 596) described in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect\nexposure to IMFINZI 1,500 mg in combination with tremelimumab-actl 75 mg and\nhistology-based platinum chemotherapy regimens in 330 patients in POSEIDON and 266\npatients with ES-SCLC in CASPIAN who received up to four cycles of platinum-etoposide\nplus IMFINZI 1,500 mg with tremelimumab-actl 75 mg every 3 weeks followed by\nIMFINZI 1,500 mg every 4 weeks (an unapproved regimen for extensive stage small cell\nlung cancer). Among the 596 patients, 55% were exposed to IMFINZI for 6 months or\nmore and 24% were exposed for 12 months or more.\nThe data described in this section reflect exposure to IMFINZI in patients with Stage III\nNSCLC enrolled in the PACIFIC study, in patients with metastatic NSCLC enrolled in the\nPOSEIDON study, in patients with ES-SCLC enrolled in the CASPIAN study, in patients\nwith BTC enrolled in the TOPAZ 1 study, in patients with uHCC included in the HIMALAYA\nstudy and in patients with dMMR endometrial cancer enrolled in the DUO-E study.\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer\nStage III NSCLC - PACIFIC\nThe safety of IMFINZI in patients with Stage III NSCLC who completed concurrent\nplatinum-based chemoradiotherapy within 42 days prior to initiation of study drug was\nevaluated in the PACIFIC study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled study. A total of 475 patients received IMFINZI 10 mg/kg intravenously every\n2 weeks. The study excluded patients who had disease progression following\nchemoradiation, with active or prior autoimmune disease within 2 years of initiation of\nthe study or with medical conditions that required systemic immunosuppression [see\nClinical Studies (14.1)].\nThe study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 23 to 90),\n45% age 65 years or older, 70% male, 69% White, 27% Asian, 75% former smoker,\n16% current smoker, and 51% had WHO performance status of 1. All patients received\ndefinitive radiotherapy as per protocol, of which 92% received a total radiation dose of\n54 Gy to 66 Gy. The median duration of exposure to IMFINZI was 10 months (range: 0.2\nto 12.6).\nIMFINZI was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 15% of patients. The most\ncommon adverse reactions leading to IMFINZI discontinuation were pneumonitis or\nradiation pneumonitis in 6% of patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 29% of\npatients receiving IMFINZI. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at\nleast 2% of patients were pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis (7%) and pneumonia\n(6%). Fatal pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis and fatal pneumonia occurred in < 2%\nof patients and were similar across arms. The most common adverse reactions\n(occurring in \u2265 20% of patients) were cough, fatigue, pneumonitis or radiation\npneumonitis, upper respiratory tract infections, dyspnea, and rash.\nTable 5 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients\ntreated with IMFINZI.\nTable 5.

A total of\n330 patients received IMFINZI 1,500 mg in combination with tremelimumab-actl (\u2265 30 kg\nbody weight received 75 mg and < 30 kg body weight received 1 mg/kg) and histology-\nbased platinum chemotherapy regimens [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Of these patients,\n66% received the maximum 5 doses of tremelimumab-actl and 79% received at least 4\ndoses. Treatment was continued with IMFINZI as a single agent (or with IMFINZI and\nhistologically-based pemetrexed for non-squamous patients based on the investigator\u2019s\ndecision) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The trial excluded patients\nwith active or prior autoimmune disease or with medical conditions that required\nsystemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].\nThe median age of patients who received IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab-actl\nand platinum-based chemotherapy was 63 years (range: 27 to 87); 80% male; 61%\nWhite, 29% Asian, 58% former smoker, 25% current smoker, and 68% ECOG\nperformance of 1.\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving IMFINZI in combination\nwith tremelimumab-actl and platinum-based chemotherapy. The most frequent serious\nadverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia (11%), anemia\n(5%), diarrhea (2.4%), thrombocytopenia (2.4%), pyrexia (2.4%), and febrile neutropenia\n(2.1%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in a total of 4.2% of patients receiving IMFINZI\nin combination with tremelimumab-actl and platinum-based chemotherapy. These include\nhepatitis, nephritis, myocarditis, pancreatitis (all in the same patient), death (2 patients),\nsepsis (2 patients), pneumonitis (2 patients), acute kidney injury (2 patients), febrile\nneutropenia (1 patient), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (1 patient),\ndyspnea (1 patient), sudden death (1 patient), and ischemic stroke (1 patient).\nPermanent discontinuation of IMFINZI or tremelimumab-actl due to an adverse reaction\noccurred in 17% of the patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent\ndiscontinuation of IMFINZI or tremelimumab-actl in > 2% of patients included\npneumonia.\nDosage interruption or delay of IMFINZI and tremelimumab-actl due to an adverse\nreaction occurred in 41% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage\nGraded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0.\nEach test incidence is based on the number of patients who had both baseline and at least one\non-study laboratory measurement available: IMFINZI (range: 464 to 470) and placebo (range: 224\nto 228).\ninterruption or delay of IMFINZI and tremelimumab-actl in > 1% of patients included\nanemia, leukopenia/white blood cell count decreased, pneumonia, pneumonitis, colitis,\ndiarrhea, hepatitis, rash, asthenia, amylase increased, alanine aminotransferase\nincreased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, lipase increased, neutropenia/\nneutrophil count decreased, and thrombocytopenia/platelet count decreased.\nThe most common adverse reactions (occurring in \u2265 20% of patients) were nausea,\nfatigue, musculoskeletal pain, decreased appetite, rash, and diarrhea.

Human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) is\nknown to cross the placental barrier; therefore, durvalumab has the potential to be\ntransmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. Apprise pregnant women of the\npotential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.\nIncludes nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, tracheobronchitis, and\nupper respiratory tract infection.\nIncludes blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased, and hypothyroidism.\n*\n\u2021\nEach test incidence is based on the number of patients who had both baseline and at least one\non-study laboratory measurement available: IMFINZI with carboplatin and paclitaxel (range: 40 to\n44), and carboplatin and paclitaxel (range: 37 to 46).\nData\nAnimal Data\nAs reported in the literature, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a central role in preserving\npregnancy by maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the fetus. In mouse allogeneic\npregnancy models, disruption of PD-L1 signaling was shown to result in an increase in\nfetal loss. The effects of durvalumab on prenatal and postnatal development were\nevaluated in reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys. Durvalumab was\nadministered from the confirmation of pregnancy through delivery at exposure levels\napproximately 6 to 20 times higher than those observed at a clinical dose of 10 mg/kg\n(based on AUC). Administration of durvalumab resulted in premature delivery, fetal loss\n(abortion and stillbirth), and increase in neonatal deaths. Durvalumab was detected in\ninfant serum on postpartum Day 1, indicating the presence of placental transfer of\ndurvalumab. Based on its mechanism of action, fetal exposure to durvalumab may\nincrease the risk of developing immune-mediated disorders or altering the normal\nimmune response and immune-mediated disorders have been reported in PD-1\nknockout mice.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of durvalumab in human milk, its effects on the\nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Maternal IgG is known to be present in\nhuman milk. The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure\nin the breastfed child to IMFINZI are unknown. Durvalumab was present in the milk of\nlactating cynomolgus monkeys and was associated with premature neonatal death (see\nData).\nBecause of the potential for adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to\nbreastfeed during treatment with IMFINZI and for 3 months after the last dose. Refer to\nthe Prescribing Information for the agents administered in combination with IMFINZI for\nrecommended duration to not breastfeed, as appropriate.\nData\nIn lactating cynomolgus monkeys, durvalumab was present in breast milk at about\n0.15% of maternal serum concentrations after administration of durvalumab from the\nconfirmation of pregnancy through delivery at exposure levels approximately 6 to 20\ntimes higher than those observed at the recommended clinical dose of 10 mg/kg (based\non AUC). Administration of durvalumab resulted in premature neonatal death.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nPregnancy testing\nVerify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment\nwith IMFINZI.\nContraception\nFemales\nIMFINZI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective\ncontraception during treatment with IMFINZI and for 3 months following the last dose of\nIMFINZI. Refer to the Prescribing Information for the agents administered in combination\nwith IMFINZI for recommended contraception duration, as appropriate.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of IMFINZI have not been established in pediatric patients.\nSafety and efficacy were assessed but not established in a multi-center, open-label study\n(NCT03837899) in 45 pediatric patients aged 1 to < 17 years with advanced solid\ntumors. All 45 patients received at least a single dose of IMFINZI, and 41 patients\nreceived IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab-actl. No new safety signals were\nobserved in pediatric patients in this study.\nDurvalumab systemic exposure in pediatric patients weighing \u2265 35 kg was within the\nrange of values previously observed in adults given the same weight-based dose,\nwhereas the systemic exposure in pediatric patients weighing < 35 kg was lower than\nthat observed in adults.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the 476 patients treated with IMFINZI in the PACIFIC study, 45% were 65 years or\nolder, while 7.6% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or\neffectiveness were observed between patients 65 years or older and younger patients.\nThe PACIFIC study did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 75 years and over\nto determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.\nOf the 265 patients with ES-SCLC treated with IMFINZI in combination with\nchemotherapy 101 (38%) patients were 65 years or older and 19 (7.2%) patients were\n75 years or older. There were no clinically meaningful differences in safety or efficacy\nbetween patients 65 years or older and younger patients.\nOf the 330 patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with IMFINZI in combination with\ntremelimumab-actl and platinum-based chemotherapy, 143 (43%) patients were 65\nyears or older and 35 (11%) patients were 75 years or older. There were no clinically\nmeaningful differences in safety or efficacy between patients 65 years or older and\nyounger patients.\nOf the 338 patients with BTC treated with IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy in\nthe TOPAZ-1 study, 158 (47%) patients were 65 years or older and 38 (11%) patients\nwere 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of IMFINZI have\nbeen observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients.\nOf the 393 patients with uHCC treated with IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab-\nactl, 50% of patients were 65 years of age or older and 13% of patients were 75 years\nof age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of IMFINZI have been\nobserved between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients.\nOf the 235 patients with endometrial cancer treated with IMFINZI with carboplatin and\npaclitaxel, 49% of patients were 65 years of age or older and 12% of patients were 75\nyears of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of IMFINZI have\nbeen observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nDurvalumab is a programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking antibody. Durvalumab\nis a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1\u03ba) monoclonal antibody that is produced by\nrecombinant DNA technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell suspension culture.\nIMFINZI (durvalumab) Injection for intravenous use is a sterile, preservative-free, clear to\nopalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution, free from visible particles.\nEach 500 mg vial of IMFINZI contains 500 mg of durvalumab in 10 mL solution. Each mL\ncontains durvalumab, 50 mg, L-histidine (2 mg), L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate\n(2.7 mg), \u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose dihydrate (104 mg), Polysorbate 80 (0.2 mg), and Water for\nInjection, USP.\nEach 120 mg vial of IMFINZI contains 120 mg of durvalumab in 2.4 mL solution. Each\nmL contains durvalumab, 50 mg, L-histidine (2 mg), L-histidine hydrochloride\nmonohydrate (2.7 mg), \u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose dihydrate (104 mg), Polysorbate 80 (0.2 mg), and\nWater for Injection, USP.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nExpression of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) can be induced by inflammatory\nsignals (e.g., IFN-gamma) and can be expressed on both tumor cells and tumor-\nassociated immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. PD-L1 blocks T-cell function\nand activation through interaction with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). By binding to its\nreceptors, PD-L1 reduces cytotoxic T-cell activity, proliferation, and cytokine production.\nDurvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1\u03ba) monoclonal antibody that\nbinds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). Blockade\nof PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/CD80 interactions releases the inhibition of immune\nresponses, without inducing antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).\nPD-L1 blockade with durvalumab led to increased T-cell activation in vitro and decreased\ntumor size in co-engrafted human tumor and immune cell xenograft mouse models.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nThe steady state AUC, Ctrough, and C\n in patients administered with 1,500 mg every\n4 weeks are 6% higher, 19% lower, and 55% higher than those administered with 10\nmg/kg every 2 weeks, respectively. Based on the modeling of pharmacokinetic data and\nexposure relationships for safety, there are no anticipated clinically meaningful\ndifferences in efficacy and safety for the doses of 1,500 mg every 4 weeks compared to\n10 mg/kg every 2 weeks in patients weighing > 30 kg with NSCLC.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of durvalumab as a single agent was studied in patients with\ndoses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg (0.01 times the approved recommended dosage) to 20\nmg/kg (2 times the approved recommended dosage) administered once every two,\nthree, or four weeks.\nPK exposure increased more than dose-proportionally at doses < 3 mg/kg (0.3 times\nthe approved recommended dosage) and dose proportionally at doses \u2265 3 mg/kg every\nmax\n2 weeks. Steady state was achieved at approximately 16 weeks.\nThe pharmacokinetics of durvalumab is similar when assessed as a single agent, when in\ncombination with chemotherapy, when in combination with tremelimumab-actl and when\nin combination with tremelimumab-actl and platinum-based chemotherapy.\nDistribution\nThe geometric mean (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) steady state volume of\ndistribution (Vss) was 5.4 (13.1%) L.\nElimination\nDurvalumab clearance decreases over time, with a mean maximal reduction (CV%) from\nbaseline values of approximately 23% (57%) resulting in a geometric mean (CV%) steady\nstate clearance (CLss) of 8 mL/h (39%) at day 365; the decrease in CLss is not\nconsidered clinically relevant. The geometric mean (CV%) terminal half-life, based on\nbaseline CL was approximately 21 (26%) days.\nSpecific Populations\nThere were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of durvalumab\nbased on body weight (31 to 175 kg), age (19 to 96 years), sex, race (White, Black,\nAsian, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, or Native American), albumin levels (4 to 57 g/L),\nlactate dehydrogenase levels (18 to 15,800 U/L), soluble PD-L1 (67 to 3,470 pg/mL),\ntumor type (NSCLC, SCLC, BTC and HCC), mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30\nto 89 mL/min), and mild or moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin \u2264 3x ULN and any\nAST). The effect of severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min) or severe hepatic\nimpairment (bilirubin > 3x ULN and any AST) on the pharmacokinetics of durvalumab is\nunknown.\n12.6 Immunogenicity\nThe observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) is highly dependent on the\nsensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude\nmeaningful comparison of the incidence of ADAs in the studies described below with the\nincidence of ADAs in other studies including those of IMFINZI.\nDuring the 10 to 48 week treatment period across PACIFIC, CASPIAN, TOPAZ-1,\nHIMALAYA, POSEIDON, DUO-E and other clinical trials, patients received IMFINZI at\ndosages of 1,500 mg every 4 weeks, 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks\nas a single agent or 1,120 mg every 3 weeks, or 1,500 mg every 3 weeks in the\ncombination therapies. 2.9% (126/4292) of evaluable patients tested positive for anti-\ndurvalumab antibodies, and 21.4% (27/126) of ADA positive patients had neutralizing\nantibodies against durvalumab. There were no identified clinically significant effects of\nADAs on durvalumab pharmacokinetics or safety; however, the effect of these ADAs on\nthe effectiveness of IMFINZI is unknown.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nThe carcinogenic and genotoxic potential of durvalumab have not been evaluated.\nAnimal fertility studies have not been conducted with durvalumab. In repeat-dose\ntoxicology studies with durvalumab in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys of up to 3\nmonths duration, there were no notable effects on the male and female reproductive\norgans.\n13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nIn animal models, inhibition of PD-L1/PD-1 signaling increased the severity of some\ninfections and enhanced inflammatory responses. Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected\nPD-1 knockout mice exhibit markedly decreased survival compared with wild-type\ncontrols, which correlated with increased bacterial proliferation and inflammatory\nresponses in these animals. PD-1 blockade using a primate anti-PD-1 antibody was also\nshown to exacerbate M. tuberculosis infection in rhesus macaques. PD-L1 and PD-1\nknockout mice have also shown decreased survival following infection with lymphocytic\nchoriomeningitis virus.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)\nUnresectable Stage III NSCLC - PACIFIC\nThe efficacy of IMFINZI was evaluated in the PACIFIC study (NCT02125461), a\nmulticenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with\nunresectable Stage III NSCLC who completed at least 2 cycles of concurrent platinum-\nbased chemotherapy and definitive radiation within 42 days prior to initiation of the\nstudy drug and had a WHO performance status of 0 or 1. The study excluded patients\nwho had progressed following concurrent chemoradiation, patients with active or prior\ndocumented autoimmune disease within 2 years of initiation of the study or patients with\nmedical conditions that required systemic immunosuppression. Randomization was\nstratified by sex, age (< 65 years vs. \u2265 65 years), and smoking history (smoker vs.\nnon-smoker). Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive IMFINZI 10 mg/kg or placebo\nintravenously every 2 weeks for up to 12 months or until unacceptable toxicity or\nconfirmed RECIST v1.1-defined progression. Assessment of tumor status was\nperformed every 8 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were progression-free\nsurvival (PFS) as assessed by a BICR RECIST v1.1, and overall survival (OS). Additional\nefficacy outcome measures included ORR and DoR assessed by BICR.\nA total of 713 patients were randomized: 476 patients to the IMFINZI arm and 237 to\nthe placebo arm. The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years\n(range: 23 to 90); 70% male; 69% White and 27% Asian; 16% current smokers, 75%\nformer smokers, and 9% never smokers; 51% WHO performance status of 1; 53% with\nStage IIIA and 45% were Stage IIIB; 46% with squamous and 54% with non-squamous\nhistology. All patients received definitive radiotherapy as per protocol, of which 92%\nreceived a total radiation dose of 54 Gy to 66 Gy; 99% of patients received concomitant\nplatinum-based chemotherapy (55% cisplatin-based, 42% carboplatin-based\nchemotherapy, and 2% switched between cisplatin and carboplatin).\nAt a pre-specified interim analysis for OS based on 299 events (61% of total planned\nevents), the study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS in patients\nrandomized to IMFINZI compared to placebo. The pre-specified interim analysis of PFS\nbased on 371 events (81% of total planned events) demonstrated a statistically\nbased on 371 events (81% of total planned events) demonstrated a statistically\nsignificant improvement in PFS in patients randomized to IMFINZI compared to placebo.\nTable 17 and Figure 1 summarizes the efficacy results for PACIFIC.\nTable 17.

Eligible patients had Eastern\nCooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1 and must have had\nno prior chemotherapy or any other systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC. Choice of\nplatinum-based chemotherapy was at the investigator\u2019s discretion, taking into\nconsideration the calculated creatinine clearance. Patients with active and/or untreated\nbrain metastases; a history of active primary immunodeficiency; autoimmune disorders\nincluding active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders; use of\nsystemic immunosuppressants within 14 days before the first dose of the treatment\nexcept physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids were ineligible.\nRandomization was stratified by tumor cells (TC) PD-L1 expression (TC \u2265 50% vs. TC <\n50%), disease stage (Stage IVA vs. Stage IVB), and histology (non-squamous vs.\nsquamous).\nPatients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab-\nactl and platinum-based chemotherapy according to the regimens listed below, IMFINZI\nand platinum-based chemotherapy (an unapproved regimen for metastatic NSCLC), or\nplatinum-based chemotherapy. The evaluation of efficacy for metastatic NSCLC relied on\ncomparison between:\n\u2022\n\u2022\nPatients received IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab-actl with one of the\nfollowing platinum-based chemotherapy regimens:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nTremelimumab-actl was given up to a maximum of 5 doses. IMFINZI and histology-\nbased pemetrexed continued every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable\ntoxicity. Administration of IMFINZI monotherapy was permitted beyond disease\nprogression if the patient was clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as determined\nby the investigator. Patients with disease progression during IMFINZI monotherapy were\ngiven the option to be retreated with 4 additional cycles of tremelimumab-actl in\ncombination with IMFINZI. Tumor assessments were performed at Week 6, Week 12,\nand then every 8 weeks thereafter.\nThe major efficacy outcome measures were progression free survival (PFS) and overall\nsurvival (OS) of IMFINZI and tremelimumab-actl in combination with platinum-based\nchemotherapy compared to platinum-based chemotherapy alone. Additional efficacy\noutcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR).\nPFS, ORR, and DoR were assessed using Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR)\naccording to RECIST v1.1.\nA total of 675 patients were randomized to receive either IMFINZI with tremelimumab-\nactl and platinum-based-chemotherapy (n = 338) or platinum-based chemotherapy (n =\n337).

The trial enrolled patients with\nnewly diagnosed Stage III disease (with measurable disease per RECIST v1.1), or newly\ndiagnosed Stage IV disease. The trial also enrolled patients with recurrent disease with a\nlow potential for cure by radiation therapy or surgery. For patients with recurrent\ndisease, prior chemotherapy was allowed only if it was administered in the adjuvant\nsetting and at least 12 months had elapsed from the date of last dose of chemotherapy\nto the date of relapse. The trial included patients with epithelial endometrial carcinomas\nof all histologies, including carcinosarcomas. Patients with endometrial sarcoma were\nexcluded, and patients who had active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that\nrequired immunosuppression were ineligible.\nRandomization was stratified by tumor mismatch repair (MMR) status (proficient or\ndeficient), disease status (recurrent or newly diagnosed), and geographic region (Asia or\nrest of the world). MMR status was assessed using an immunohistochemistry tumor\ntissue test.\nPatients were randomized (1:1:1) to one of the following treatment arms:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nTreatment was continued until Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)\nIMFINZI 1,120 mg in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel every 3 weeks for\na maximum of 6 cycles. Following completion of chemotherapy treatment, patients\nreceived IMFINZI 1,500 mg every 4 weeks as maintenance treatment until disease\nprogression.\nPlacebo in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel every 3 weeks for a\nmaximum of 6 cycles. Following completion of chemotherapy treatment, patients\nreceived placebo every 4 weeks as maintenance treatment until disease\nprogression.\nAn additional investigational combination regimen.\nv1.1-defined progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. Assessment of tumor\nstatus was performed every 9 weeks for the first 18 weeks and every 12 weeks\nthereafter.\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), determined\nby investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures\nincluded overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR) and overall survival\n(OS).\nAmong 95 patients with dMMR tumor, the baseline characteristics were median age of\n63 years (range: 34 to 85); 47% age 65 or older; 62% White, 31% Asian, 2% Black or\nAfrican American; 7% Hispanic or Latino, 1% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 4%\nother or not reported; ECOG PS of 0 (55%) or 1 (45%); 48% newly diagnosed (11%\nStage III and 38% Stage IV) and 52% recurrent disease. The histologic subtypes were\nendometrioid (78%), mixed epithelial (6%), carcinosarcoma (5%), serous (4%),\nundifferentiated (1%), and other (5%).\nWhile a statistically significant improvement in PFS was observed in the overall population\nfor IMFINZI with carboplatin and paclitaxel compared to carboplatin and paclitaxel alone,\nbased on an exploratory analysis by MMR status, the PFS improvement in the overall\npopulation was primarily attributed to patients with dMMR tumors.\nEfficacy results for DUO-E are summarized in Table 22 and Figure 6 for patients with\ndMMR tumors. OS data in this subpopulation at the time of PFS analysis were immature\nwith 26% of patients who died.\nTable 22.

If unable to perform confirmatory MSI-H/dMMR testing,\nthe presence of TMB \u226510 mut/Mb, as determined by an FDA-approved test, may be\nused to select patients for treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.7)].\nPatient Selection for Combination Therapy\nFor use of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy and trastuzumab, select\npatients based on the presence of positive PD-L1 expression (CPS \u22651) in locally\nadvanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal\njunction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma [see Clinical Studies (14.9)].\nFor use of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab,\nselect patients based on the presence of positive PD-L1 expression in persistent,\nrecurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer [see Clinical Studies (14.11)].\nFor the pMMR/not MSI-H advanced endometrial carcinoma indication, select patients for\ntreatment with KEYTRUDA in combination with lenvatinib based on MSI or MMR status in\ntumor specimens [see Clinical Studies (14.16)].\nFor use of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, select patients based on the\npresence of positive PD-L1 expression in locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic\nTNBC [see Clinical Studies (14.19)].\nAdditional Patient Selection Information\nAn FDA-approved test for the detection of not MSI-H is currently unavailable for the\nselection of patients

The solution is\nclear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow. Discard the vial if visible\nparticles are observed.\nDilute KEYTRUDA injection (solution) prior to intravenous administration.\nWithdraw the required volume from the vial(s) of KEYTRUDA and transfer into an\nintravenous (IV) bag containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose\nInjection, USP. Mix diluted solution by gentle inversion. Do not shake. The final\nconcentration of the diluted solution should be between 1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL.\nDiscard any unused portion left in the vial.\nStorage of Diluted Solution\nThe product does not contain a preservative.\nStore the diluted solution from the KEYTRUDA 100 mg/4 mL vial either:\nAt room temperature for no more than 6 hours from the time of dilution. This\nincludes room temperature storage of the diluted solution, and the duration of\ninfusion.\nConsider corticosteroid therapy\nBased on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE),\nversion 4.0. Consider rechallenge with a single drug or sequential\nrechallenge with both drugs after recovery. If rechallenging with axitinib,\nconsider dose reduction as per the axitinib Prescribing Information.\n*\n\u2020\nUnder refrigeration at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for no more than 96 hours from the\ntime of dilution. If refrigerated, allow the diluted solution to come to room\ntemperature prior to administration. Do not shake.\nDiscard after 6 hours at room temperature or after 96 hours under refrigeration.\nDo not freeze.\nAdministration\nAdminister diluted solution intravenously over 30 minutes through an intravenous line\ncontaining a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein binding 0.2 micron to 5 micron in-line\nor add-on filter.\nDo not co-administer other drugs through the same infusion line.\n3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nInjection: 100 mg/4 mL (25 mg/mL) clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly\nyellow solution in a single-dose vial\n4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nNone.\n5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n5.1 Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions\nKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either\nthe programmed death-receptor 1 (PD-1) or the PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-\n1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially\nbreaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions.\nImportant immune-mediated adverse reactions listed under WARNINGS AND\nPRECAUTIONS may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse\nreactions.\nImmune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any\norgan system or tissue and can affect more than one body system simultaneously.\nImmune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting treatment with\na PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually\nmanifest during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, immune-mediated\nadverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking\nantibodies.\nEarly identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are\nessential to ensure safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor patients closely\nfor symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-\nmediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at\nbaseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with\nKEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to\nsurgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse\nreactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including\ninfection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as\nappropriate.\nWithhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3)]. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation,\nadminister systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent)\nuntil improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate\ncorticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider\nadministration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-\nmediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.\nToxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require\nsystemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed\nbelow.\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is\nhigher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated\npneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal\n(0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) adverse reactions.\nSystemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients with pneumonitis.\nPneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) of patients and\nwithholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld\nreinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence of\npneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.\nIn clinical studies enrolling 389 adult patients with cHL who received KEYTRUDA as a\nsingle agent, pneumonitis occurred in 31 (8%) patients, including Grades 3-4\npneumonitis in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a\nmedian duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were\nsimilar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to\ndiscontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 21 (5.4%) patients. Of the patients who developed\npneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had\nresolution.\nIn a clinical study enrolling 580 adult patients with resected NSCLC (KEYNOTE-091) who\nreceived KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment, pneumonitis occurred in\n41 (7%) patients, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse\nreactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days\n(range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26\n(4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted\nKEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.\nImmune-Mediated Colitis\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea.\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with\ncorticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory\ncolitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-\nmediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including\nGrade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse reactions. Systemic\ncorticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48) of patients with colitis. Additional\nimmunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent\ndiscontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in\n0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after\nsymptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence of colitis. Colitis resolved in 85%\nof the 48 patients.\nHepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis\nKEYTRUDA as a Single Agent\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred\nin 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3\n(0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required\nin 68% (13/19) of patients with hepatitis. Eleven percent of these patients required\nadditional immunosuppressant therapy. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of\nKEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.3% (9) of patients.\nAll patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of\nthese, none had recurrence of hepatitis. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.\nKEYTRUDA with Axitinib\nKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than\nexpected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to\nKEYTRUDA alone. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout\ntreatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when\nthe drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt\nKEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed [see\nDosage and Administration (2.3)].\nWith the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%)\nand increased AST (13%) were seen. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased\nALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT \u22653 times ULN (Grades 2-4,\nn=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were\nrechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single\nagent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT \u22653 times ULN was observed in 1 patient\nreceiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both\nKEYTRUDA and axitinib. All patients with a recurrence of ALT \u22653 ULN subsequently\nrecovered from the event.\nImmune-Mediated Endocrinopathies\nAdrenal Insufficiency\nKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher\nadrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as\nclinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3)].\nAdrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA,\nincluding Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions.\nSystemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients with adrenal\ninsufficiency; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal\ninsufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) of patients\nand withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld\nreinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.\nHypophysitis\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with\nacute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual\nfield defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as\nindicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity [see\nDosage and Administration (2.3)].\nHypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including\nGrade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) adverse reactions. Systemic\ncorticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients with hypophysitis; of these, the\nmajority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent\ndiscontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in\n0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom\nimprovement.\nThyroid Disorders\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with\nor without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate\nhormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of\nhyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA\ndepending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\nThyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade\n2 (0.3%). No patients discontinued KEYTRUDA due to thyroiditis. KEYTRUDA was\nwithheld in <0.1% (1) of patients.\nHyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including\nGrade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). Hyperthyroidism led to permanent discontinuation\nof KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (2) of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.3% (7) of\npatients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom\nimprovement.\nThe incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with\nresected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as\nadjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism.\nHypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including\nGrade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). Hypothyroidism led to permanent discontinuation\nof KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (14) of\npatients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom\nimprovement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid\nhormone replacement.\nThe incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with\nHNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in\ncombination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The\nincidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 patients with cHL\n(17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2\n(10.8%) hypothyroidism.\nThe incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with\nresected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as\nadjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism.\nType 1 Diabetes Mellitus, which can present with Diabetic Ketoacidosis\nMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate\ntreatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity\n[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\nType 1 diabetes mellitus occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA.\nType 1 diabetes mellitus led to permanent discontinuation in <0.1% (1) of patients and\nwithholding of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) of patients. All patients who were withheld\nreinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. All patients with Type 1 diabetes\nmellitus required long-term insulin therapy.\nImmune-Mediated Nephritis with Renal Dysfunction\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred\nin 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3\n(0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required\nin 89% (8/9) of patients with nephritis. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of\nKEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) of patients.\nAll patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of\nthese, none had recurrence of nephritis. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.\nImmune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis,\nincluding Stevens Johnson Syndrome, DRESS, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), has\noccurred with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Topical emollients and/or topical\ncorticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate non-exfoliative rashes.\nWithhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3)].\nImmune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of\npatients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse\nreactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients with\nimmune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions. Immune-mediated dermatologic\nadverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (2) of patients\nand withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld\nreinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence of\nimmune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions. Immune-mediated dermatologic\nadverse reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.\nOther Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions\nThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an\nincidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were\nreported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Severe or fatal cases\nhave been reported for some of these adverse reactions.\nCardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis\nNervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic\nsyndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, nerve\nparesis, autoimmune neuropathy\nOcular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can\nbe associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including\nblindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated\nadverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require\ntreatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.\nGastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels,\ngastritis, duodenitis\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and\nassociated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica\nEndocrine: Hypoparathyroidism\nHematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic\nlymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing\nlymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura,\nsolid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection\n5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions\nKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including\nhypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients\nreceiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related\nreactions including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension,\nhypoxemia, and fever. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for mild (Grade 1) or\nmoderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. For severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening\n(Grade 4) infusion-related reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue\nKEYTRUDA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.3 Complications of Allogeneic HSCT\nFatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic\nhematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-\n1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-\nversus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive\ndisease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile\nsyndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur\ndespite intervening therapy between PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT.\nFollow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene\npromptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking\nantibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.\n5.4 Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when KEYTRUDA is\nAdded to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone\nIn two randomized trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to\na thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, a use for which no PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking\nantibody is indicated, resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple\nmyeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide\nanalogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled trials.\n5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered\nto a pregnant woman. Animal models link the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway with\nmaintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal\ntissue. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive\npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4\nmonths after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the\nlabeling.\nSevere and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions\n(5.1)].\nInfusion-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to\nKEYTRUDA as a single agent in 2799 patients in three randomized, open-label, active-\ncontrolled trials (KEYNOTE-002, KEYNOTE-006, and KEYNOTE-010), which enrolled 912\npatients with melanoma and 682 patients with NSCLC, and one single-arm trial\n(KEYNOTE-001), which enrolled 655 patients with melanoma and 550 patients with\nNSCLC. In addition to the 2799 patients, certain subsections in the WARNINGS AND\nPRECAUTIONS describe adverse reactions observed with exposure to KEYTRUDA as a\nsingle agent in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (KEYNOTE-091), which enrolled 580\npatients with resected NSCLC, a non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort trial\n(KEYNOTE-012), a non-randomized, open-label, single-cohort trial (KEYNOTE-055), and\ntwo randomized, open-label, active-controlled trials (KEYNOTE-040 and KEYNOTE-048\nsingle agent arms), which enrolled 909 patients with HNSCC; in two non-randomized,\nopen-label trials (KEYNOTE-013 and KEYNOTE-087) and one randomized, open-label,\nactive-controlled trial (KEYNOTE-204), which enrolled 389 patients with cHL; in a\nrandomized, open-label, active-controlled trial (KEYNOTE-048 combination arm), which\nenrolled 276 patients with HNSCC; in combination with axitinib in a randomized, active-\ncontrolled trial (KEYNOTE-426), which enrolled 429 patients with RCC; and in post-\nmarketing use. Across all trials, KEYTRUDA was administered at doses of 2 mg/kg\nintravenously every 3 weeks, 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks, 10 mg/kg\nintravenously every 3 weeks, or 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. Among the 2799\npatients, 41% were exposed for 6 months or more and 21% were exposed for 12\nmonths or more.\nMelanoma\nIpilimumab-Naive Melanoma\nThe safety of KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic\nmelanoma who had not received prior ipilimumab and who had received no more than\none prior systemic therapy was investigated in KEYNOTE-006. KEYNOTE-006 was a\nmulticenter, open-label, active-controlled trial where patients were randomized (1:1:1)\nand received KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=278) or KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg\nevery 3 weeks (n=277) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or ipilimumab\n3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses unless discontinued earlier for disease progression\nor unacceptable toxicity (n=256) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients with autoimmune\ndisease, a medical condition that required systemic corticosteroids or other\nimmunosuppressive medication; a history of interstitial lung disease; or active infection\nrequiring therapy, including HIV or hepatitis B or C, were ineligible.\nThe median duration of exposure was 5.6 months (range: 1 day to 11.0 months) for\nKEYTRUDA and similar in both treatment arms. Fifty-one and 46% of patients received\nKEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks, respectively, for \u22656 months. No patients in\neither arm received treatment for more than one year.\nThe study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 18 to 89);\n60% male; 98% White; 32% had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value at\nbaseline; 65% had M1c stage disease; 9% with history of brain metastasis; and\napproximately 36% had been previously treated with systemic therapy which included a\nBRAF inhibitor (15%), chemotherapy (13%), and immunotherapy (6%).\nIn KEYNOTE-006, the adverse reaction profile was similar for the every 2 week and every\n3 week schedule, therefore summary safety results are provided in a pooled analysis\n(n=555) of both KEYTRUDA arms. Adverse reactions leading to permanent\ndiscontinuation of KEYTRUDA occurred in 9% of patients. Adverse reactions leading to\ndiscontinuation of KEYTRUDA in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune\nhepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure\n(0.4%).

Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required\nimmunosuppression were ineligible for KEYNOTE-012.\nThe study population characteristics were: median age of 60 years (range: 20 to 84),\n35% age 65 or older; 83% male; and 77% White, 15% Asian, and 5% Black. Sixty-one\npercent of patients had two or more lines of therapy in the recurrent or metastatic\nsetting, and 95% had prior radiation therapy. Baseline ECOG PS was 0 (30%) or 1 (70%)\nand 86% had M1 disease.\nKEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 17% of patients. Serious\nadverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most frequent\nserious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia, dyspnea,\nconfusional state, vomiting, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The incidence of\nadverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, was similar between dosage\nregimens (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 200 mg every 3 weeks); therefore, summary\nsafety results are provided in a pooled analysis. The most common adverse reactions\n(occurring in \u226520% of patients) were fatigue, decreased appetite, and dyspnea. Adverse\nreactions occurring in patients with HNSCC were generally similar to those occurring in\n2799 patients with melanoma or NSCLC treated with KEYTRUDA as a single agent, with\nthe exception of increased incidences of facial edema (10% all Grades; 2.1% Grades 3-4)\nand new or worsening hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\nRelapsed or Refractory cHL\nKEYNOTE-204\nThe safety of KEYTRUDA was evaluated in KEYNOTE-204 [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].\nAdults with relapsed or refractory cHL received KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every\n3 weeks (n=148) or brentuximab vedotin (BV) 1.8 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks\n(n=152). The trial required an ANC \u22651000/\u00b5L, platelet count \u226575,000/\u00b5L, hepatic\ntransaminases \u22642.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), bilirubin \u22641.5 times ULN, and\nECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The trial excluded patients with active non-\ninfectious pneumonitis, prior pneumonitis requiring steroids, active autoimmune disease,\na medical condition requiring immunosuppression, or allogeneic HSCT within the past 5\nyears. The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 10 months (range: 1 day to\n2.2 years), with 68% receiving at least 6 months of treatment and 48% receiving at least\n1 year of treatment.\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients who received KEYTRUDA.

Adverse reactions occurring in\npatients with MCC were similar to those occurring in 2799 patients with melanoma or\nNSCLC treated with KEYTRUDA as a single agent. Laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3-4)\nthat occurred at a higher incidence included increased lipase (17%).\nRCC\nEach test incidence is based on the number of patients who had both baseline and at least one\non-study laboratory measurement available: KEYTRUDA (range: 223 to 297 patients) and placebo\n(range: 144 to 151 patients).\nGraded per NCI CTCAE v4.03\nIn combination with axitinib in the first-line treatment of advanced RCC (KEYNOTE-426)\nThe safety of KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib was investigated in KEYNOTE-426\n[see Clinical Studies (14.15)]. Patients with medical conditions that required systemic\ncorticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications or had a history of severe\nautoimmune disease other than type 1 diabetes, vitiligo, Sjogren's syndrome, and\nhypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement were ineligible. Patients received\nKEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks and axitinib 5 mg orally twice daily, or\nsunitinib 50 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then off treatment for 2 weeks. The median\nduration of exposure to the combination therapy of KEYTRUDA and axitinib was 10.4\nmonths (range: 1 day to 21.2 months).\nThe study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 30 to 89),\n40% age 65 or older; 71% male; 80% White; and 80% Karnofsky Performance Status\n(KPS) of 90-100 and 20% KPS of 70-80.\nFatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.3% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination\nwith axitinib.

Serious adverse reactions in \u22651% of patients receiving\nKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib included hepatotoxicity (7%), diarrhea (4.2%),\nacute kidney injury (2.3%), dehydration (1%), and pneumonitis (1%).\nPermanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction of either KEYTRUDA or axitinib\noccurred in 31% of patients; 13% KEYTRUDA only, 13% axitinib only, and 8% both\ndrugs. The most common adverse reaction (>1%) resulting in permanent\ndiscontinuation of KEYTRUDA, axitinib, or the combination was hepatotoxicity (13%),\ndiarrhea/colitis (1.9%), acute kidney injury (1.6%), and cerebrovascular accident (1.2%).\nDose interruptions or reductions due to an adverse reaction, excluding temporary\ninterruptions of KEYTRUDA infusions due to infusion-related reactions, occurred in 76%\nof patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib. This includes interruption of\nKEYTRUDA in 50% of patients. Axitinib was interrupted in 64% of patients and dose\nreduced in 22% of patients. The most common adverse reactions (>10%) resulting in\ninterruption of KEYTRUDA were hepatotoxicity (14%) and diarrhea (11%), and the most\ncommon adverse reactions (>10%) resulting in either interruption or reduction of\naxitinib were hepatotoxicity (21%), diarrhea (19%), and hypertension (18%).\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and\naxitinib were diarrhea, fatigue/asthenia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, decreased\nappetite, hepatotoxicity, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, nausea, stomatitis/mucosal\ninflammation, dysphonia, rash, cough, and constipation.\nTwenty-seven percent (27%) of patients treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with\naxitinib received an oral prednisone dose equivalent to \u226540 mg daily for an immune-\nmediated adverse reaction.\nTables 45 and 46 summarize the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities,\nrespectively, that occurred in at least 20% of patients treated with KEYTRUDA and\naxitinib in KEYNOTE-426.\nTable 45: Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u226520% of Patients Receiving\nKEYTRUDA with Axitinib in KEYNOTE-426\n  Adverse Reaction\nKEYTRUDA \n200 mg every 3 weeks \nand Axitinib\nn=429\nSunitinib\nn=425\nAll Grades  \n(%)\nGrades 3-4\n(%)\nAll Grades\n(%)\nGrades 3-4\n(%)\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\nGastrointestinal\n  Diarrhea\n56\n11\n45\n5\n  Nausea\n28\n0.9\n32\n0.9\n  Constipation\n21\n0\n15\n0.2\nGeneral\n  Fatigue/Asthenia\n52\n5\n51\n10\nVascular\n  Hypertension\n48\n24\n48\n20\nHepatobiliary\n  Hepatotoxicity\n39\n20\n25\n4.9\nEndocrine\n  Hypothyroidism\n35\n0.2\n32\n0.2\nMetabolism and Nutrition\n  Decreased appetite\n30\n2.8\n29\n0.7\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue\n  Palmar-plantar\nerythrodysesthesia\nsyndrome\n28\n5\n40\n3.8\n  Stomatitis/Mucosal\ninflammation\n27\n1.6\n41\n4\n  Rash\n25\n1.4\n21\n0.7\nRespiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal\n  Dysphonia\n25\n0.2\n3.3\n0\n  Cough\n21\n0.2\n14\n0.5\nTable 46: Laboratory Abnormalities Worsened from Baseline Occurring in\n\u226520% of Patients Receiving KEYTRUDA with Axitinib in KEYNOTE-426\nKEYTRUDA \n*\nGraded per NCI CTCAE v4.03\nIncludes diarrhea, colitis, enterocolitis, gastroenteritis, enteritis, enterocolitis hemorrhagic\nIncludes hypertension, blood pressure increased, hypertensive crisis, labile hypertension\nIncludes ALT increased, AST increased, autoimmune hepatitis, blood bilirubin increased, drug-\ninduced liver injury, hepatic enzyme increased, hepatic function abnormal, hepatitis, hepatitis\nfulminant, hepatocellular injury, hepatotoxicity, hyperbilirubinemia, immune-mediated hepatitis,\nliver function test increased, liver injury, transaminases increased\nIncludes rash, butterfly rash, dermatitis, dermatitis acneform, dermatitis atopic, dermatitis bullous,\ndermatitis contact, exfoliative rash, genital rash, rash erythematous, rash generalized, rash\nmacular, rash maculopapular, rash papular, rash pruritic, seborrheic dermatitis, skin discoloration,\nskin exfoliation, perineal rash\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\n  Laboratory Test\n200 mg every 3 weeks \nand Axitinib\nSunitinib\nAll Grades  \n%\nGrades 3-4\n%\nAll Grades\n%\nGrades 3-4\n%\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\nChemistry\n  Hyperglycemia\n62\n9\n54\n3.2\n  Increased ALT\n60\n20\n44\n5\n  Increased AST\n57\n13\n56\n5\n  Increased creatinine\n43\n4.3\n40\n2.4\n  Hyponatremia\n35\n8\n29\n8\n  Hyperkalemia\n34\n6\n22\n1.7\n  Hypoalbuminemia\n32\n0.5\n34\n1.7\n  Hypercalcemia\n27\n0.7\n15\n1.9\n  Hypophosphatemia\n26\n6\n49\n17\n  Increased alkaline\nphosphatase\n26\n1.7\n30\n2.7\n  Hypocalcemia\n22\n0.2\n29\n0.7\n  Blood bilirubin increased\n22\n2.1\n21\n1.9\n  Activated partial\nthromboplastin time\nprolonged\n22\n1.2\n14\n0\nHematology\n  Lymphopenia\n33\n11\n46\n8\n  Anemia\n29\n2.1\n65\n8\n  Thrombocytopenia\n27\n1.4\n78\n14\nIn combination with lenvatinib in the first-line treatment of advanced RCC (KEYNOTE-\n581)\nThe safety of KEYTRUDA was evaluated in KEYNOTE-581 [see Clinical Studies (14.15)].\nPatients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks in combination with\nlenvatinib 20 mg orally once daily (n=352), or lenvatinib 18 mg orally once daily in\ncombination with everolimus 5 mg orally once daily (n=355), or sunitinib 50 mg orally\nonce daily for 4 weeks then off treatment for 2 weeks (n=340).

Laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3-4) that occurred\nat a higher incidence included lymphopenia (10%) and decreased sodium (10%).\nTNBC\nNeoadjuvant and Adjuvant Treatment of High-Risk Early-Stage TNBC\nThe safety of KEYTRUDA in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (carboplatin\nand paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) followed by\nsurgery and continued adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA as a single agent was\ninvestigated in KEYNOTE-522, a randomized (2:1), multicenter, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled trial in patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated, high-risk early-\nstage TNBC.\nA total of 778 patients on the KEYTRUDA arm received at least 1 dose of KEYTRUDA in\ncombination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by KEYTRUDA as adjuvant\ntreatment after surgery, compared to 389 patients who received at least 1 dose of\nplacebo in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by placebo as adjuvant\ntreatment after surgery [see Clinical Studies (14.19)].\nThe median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks was 13.3\nmonths (range: 1 day to 21.9 months).\nFatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.9% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including 1\neach of adrenal crisis, autoimmune encephalitis, hepatitis, pneumonia, pneumonitis,\npulmonary embolism, and sepsis in association with multiple organ dysfunction\nsyndrome and myocardial infarction.\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Serious\nadverse reactions in \u22652% of patients who received KEYTRUDA included febrile\nneutropenia (15%), pyrexia (3.7%), anemia (2.6%), and neutropenia (2.2%).\nKEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 20% of patients. The most\ncommon adverse reactions (\u22651%) resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA\nwere increased ALT (2.7%), increased AST (1.5%), and rash (1%). Adverse reactions\nleading to the interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 57% of patients. The most common\nadverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA (\u22652%) were neutropenia (26%),\nthrombocytopenia (6%), increased ALT (6%), increased AST (3.7%), anemia (3.5%), rash\n(3.2%), febrile neutropenia (2.8%), leukopenia (2.8%), upper respiratory tract infection\n(2.6%), pyrexia (2.2%), and fatigue (2.1%).\nTables 53 and 54 summarize the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities,\nrespectively, in patients treated with KEYTRUDA in KEYNOTE-522.\nTable 53: Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u226520% of Patients Receiving\nKEYTRUDA in KEYNOTE-522\n      Adverse\nReaction\nKEYTRUDA\n200 mg every 3 weeks\nwith\nchemotherapy /KEYTRUDA\nn=778\nPlacebo\nwith\nchemotherapy /Placebo\nn=389\nAll Grades  \n(%)\nGrades 3-4\n(%)\nAll Grades  \n(%)\nGrades 3-4\n(%)\nGeneral\n  Fatigue\n70\n8\n66\n3.9\n  Pyrexia\n28\n1.3\n19\n0.3\nGastrointestinal\n  Nausea\n67\n3.7\n66\n1.8\n  Constipation\n42\n0\n39\n0.3\n  Diarrhea\n41\n3.2\n34\n1.8\n  Stomatitis\n34\n2.7\n29\n1\n  Vomiting\n31\n2.7\n28\n1.5\n  Abdominal pain\n24\n0.5\n23\n0.8\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue\n  Alopecia\n61\n0\n58\n0\n  Rash\n52\n5\n41\n0.5\nNervous System\n  Peripheral\nneuropathy\n41\n3.3\n42\n2.3\n  Headache\n30\n0.5\n29\n1\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue\n  Arthralgia\n29\n0.5\n31\n0.3\n  Myalgia\n20\n0.5\n19\n0\nRespiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal\n  Cough\n26\n0.1\n24\n0\n*\n*\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\n#\n\u00de\n\u00df\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\n#\n\u00de\n\u00df\nMetabolism and Nutrition\n  Decreased appetite\n23\n0.9\n17\n0.3\nPsychiatric\n  Insomnia\n21\n0.5\n19\n0\nTable 54: Laboratory Abnormalities Worsened from Baseline\nOccurring in \u226520% of Patients Receiving KEYTRUDA in KEYNOTE-522\n      Laboratory\nTest\nKEYTRUDA\n200 mg every 3 weeks\nwith\nchemotherapy /KEYTRUDA\nPlacebo\nwith\nchemotherapy /Placebo\nAll Grades  \n%\nGrades 3-4\n%\nAll Grades  \n%\nGrades 3-4\n%\n*\nHematology\n  Anemia\n97\n22\n96\n19\n  Leukopenia\n93\n41\n91\n32\n  Neutropenia\n88\n62\n89\n62\n  Lymphopenia\n80\n28\n74\n22\n  Thrombocytopenia\n58\n11\n57\n9\nChemistry\n  Increased ALT\n71\n9\n69\n4.6\n  Increased AST\n66\n6\n58\n1.8\n  Hyperglycemia\n65\n5\n62\n2.8\n  Increased alkaline\nphosphatase\n41\n1\n37\n0.8\n  Hyponatremia\n38\n9\n28\n6\n  Hypoalbuminemia\n36\n1.2\n30\n1.5\n  Hypocalcemia\n32\n3.2\n29\n4.4\n  Hypokalemia\n32\n6\n24\n2.8\n  Hypophosphatemia\n23\n6\n18\n4.5\n  Hypercalcemia\n21\n3\n24\n3.4\nChemotherapy: carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin or epirubicin and\ncyclophosphamide\nGraded per NCI CTCAE v4.0\nIncludes asthenia, fatigue\nIncludes aphthous ulcer, cheilitis, lip pain, lip ulceration, mouth ulceration, mucosal\ninflammation, oral mucosal eruption, oral pain, stomatitis, tongue blistering, tongue\nulceration\nIncludes abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, abdominal pain lower, abdominal pain\nupper, abdominal tenderness\nIncludes dermatitis, dermatitis acneiform, dermatitis allergic, dermatitis bullous,\ndermatitis exfoliative generalized, drug eruption, eczema, incision site rash, injection\nsite rash, rash, rash erythematous, rash follicular, rash macular, rash maculo-papular,\nrash morbilliform, rash papular, rash pruritic, rash pustular, rash rubelliform, skin\nexfoliation, skin toxicity, toxic skin eruption, urticaria, vasculitic rash, viral rash\nIncludes neuropathy peripheral, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensorimotor\nneuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy\nIncludes cough, productive cough, upper-airway cough syndrome\n*\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u2021\nEach test incidence is based on the number of patients who had both baseline and at\nleast one on-study laboratory measurement available: KEYTRUDA in combination with\n\u2020\n\u2021\nLocally Recurrent Unresectable or Metastatic TNBC\nThe safety of KEYTRUDA in combination with paclitaxel, paclitaxel protein-bound, or\ngemcitabine and carboplatin was investigated in KEYNOTE-355, a multicenter, double-\nblind, randomized (2:1), placebo-controlled trial in patients with locally recurrent\nunresectable or metastatic TNBC who had not been previously treated with\nchemotherapy in the metastatic setting [see Clinical Studies (14.19)].

There are no available human data informing the risk of embryo-\nfetal toxicity. In animal models, the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway is important in the\nmaintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal\ntissue (see Data). Human IgG4 (immunoglobulins) are known to cross the placenta;\ntherefore, pembrolizumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the\ndeveloping fetus. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with KEYTRUDA to evaluate its\neffect on reproduction and fetal development. A literature-based assessment of the\neffects of the PD-1 pathway on reproduction demonstrated that a central function of\nthe PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is to preserve pregnancy by maintaining maternal immune\ntolerance to the fetus. Blockade of PD-L1 signaling has been shown in murine models of\npregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the fetus and to result in an increase in fetal loss;\ntherefore, potential risks of administering KEYTRUDA during pregnancy include\nincreased rates of abortion or stillbirth. As reported in the literature, there were no\nmalformations related to the blockade of PD-1 signaling in the offspring of these\nanimals; however, immune-mediated disorders occurred in PD-1 knockout mice. Based\non its mechanism of action, fetal exposure to pembrolizumab may increase the risk of\ndeveloping immune-mediated disorders or of altering the normal immune response.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of pembrolizumab in either animal or human milk or\nits effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Maternal IgG is known to be\npresent in human milk. The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited\nsystemic exposure in the breastfed child to KEYTRUDA are unknown. Because of the\npotential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to\nbreastfeed during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the last dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating KEYTRUDA\n[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nContraception\nKEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see\nWarnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of\nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with KEYTRUDA\nand for 4 months after the last dose.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA as a single agent have been established in\npediatric patients with melanoma, cHL, PMBCL, MCC, MSI-H or dMMR cancer, and TMB-H\ncancer. Use of KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients for these indications is supported by\nevidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional\npharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1),\nClinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.4, 14.5, 14.7, 14.14, 14.17)].\nIn KEYNOTE-051, 173 pediatric patients (65 pediatric patients aged 6 months to younger\nthan 12 years and 108 pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years) with advanced melanoma,\nlymphoma, or PD-L1 positive solid tumors received KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks.\nThe median duration of exposure was 2.1 months (range: 1 day to 25 months). Adverse\nreactions that occurred at a \u226510% higher rate in pediatric patients when compared to\nadults included pyrexia (33%), vomiting (29%), headache (25%), abdominal pain (23%),\ndecreased lymphocyte count (13%), and decreased white blood cell count (11%).\nLaboratory abnormalities that occurred at a \u226510% higher rate in pediatric patients when\ncompared to adults were leukopenia (31%), neutropenia (28%), thrombocytopenia\n(22%), and Grade 3 anemia (17%).\nThe safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients have not been\nestablished in the other approved indications [see Indications and Usage (1)].\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 3781 patients with melanoma, NSCLC, HNSCC, or urothelial carcinoma who were\ntreated with KEYTRUDA in clinical studies, 48% were 65 years and over and 17% were\n75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed\nbetween elderly patients and younger patients.\nOf 389 adult patients with cHL who were treated with KEYTRUDA in clinical studies, 46\n(12%) were 65 years and over. Patients aged 65 years and over had a higher incidence\nof serious adverse reactions (50%) than patients aged younger than 65 years (24%).\nClinical studies of KEYTRUDA in cHL did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged\n65 years and over to determine whether effectiveness differs from that in younger\npatients.\nOf 506 adult patients with Stage IB (T2a \u22654 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC following complete\nresection and platinum-based chemotherapy who were treated with KEYTRUDA in\nKEYNOTE-091, 242 (48%) were 65 years and over. No overall differences in safety or\neffectiveness were observed between elderly patients and younger patients.\nOf 596 adult patients with TNBC who were treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with\npaclitaxel, paclitaxel protein-bound, or gemcitabine and carboplatin in KEYNOTE-355, 137\n(23%) were 65 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were\nobserved between elderly patients and younger patients.\nOf 406 adult patients with endometrial carcinoma who were treated with KEYTRUDA in\ncombination with lenvatinib in KEYNOTE-775, 201 (50%) were 65 years and over. No\noverall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly patients and\nyounger patients.\nOf the 564 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer treated with\nKEYTRUDA in combination with enfortumab vedotin, 44% (n=247) were 65-74 years and\n26% (n=144) were 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness\nwere observed between patients 65 years of age or older and younger patients. Patients\n75 years of age or older treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with enfortumab vedotin\nexperienced a higher incidence of fatal adverse reactions than younger patients. The\nincidence of fatal adverse reactions was 4% in patients younger than 75 and 7% in\npatients 75 years or older.\nOf the 432 patients randomized to KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib in the\nKEYNOTE-426 trial, 40% were 65 years or older. No overall difference in safety or\nefficacy was reported between patients who were \u226565 years of age and younger.\nOf 292 adult patients with FIGO 2014 Stage III-IVA cervical cancer who were treated\nwith KEYTRUDA in combination with CRT in KEYNOTE-A18, 42 (14%) were 65 years and\nover. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between elderly and\nyounger patients.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nPembrolizumab is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD 1)-blocking antibody.\nPembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG4 kappa antibody with an approximate\nmolecular weight of 149 kDa. Pembrolizumab is produced in recombinant Chinese\nhamster ovary (CHO) cells.\nKEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) injection is a sterile, preservative-free, clear to slightly\nopalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution for intravenous use. Each vial contains\n100 mg of pembrolizumab in 4 mL of solution. Each 1 mL of solution contains 25 mg of\npembrolizumab and is formulated in: L-histidine (1.55 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.2 mg),\nsucrose (70 mg), and Water for Injection, USP.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nBinding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells,\ninhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs\nin some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active\nT-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that\nbinds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing\nPD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor\nimmune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in\ndecreased tumor growth.\nIn syngeneic mouse tumor models, combination treatment of a PD-1 blocking antibody\nand kinase inhibitor lenvatinib decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased\nactivated cytotoxic T cells, and reduced tumor growth compared to either treatment\nalone.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nThere are no clinically significant exposure-response relationships for efficacy or safety\nat pembrolizumab dosages of 200 mg or 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks regardless of cancer\ntype. There are no clinically significant exposure-response relationships for efficacy or\nsafety at pembrolizumab dosages of 200 mg or 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks and 400 mg\nevery 6 weeks in patients with solid tumors based on observed data in adult patients\nwith melanoma. The exposure-response relationships for efficacy or safety at\npembrolizumab dosages of 400 mg every 6 weeks in patients with classical Hodgkin\nlymphoma or mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma have not been fully characterized.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics (PK) of pembrolizumab was characterized using a population PK\nanalysis with concentration data collected from 2993 patients with various cancers who\nreceived pembrolizumab doses of 1 to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 2 to 10 mg/kg every 3\nweeks, or 200 mg every 3 weeks.\nSteady-state concentrations of pembrolizumab were reached by 16 weeks of repeated\ndosing with an every 3-week regimen and the systemic accumulation was 2.1-fold. The\npeak concentration (C\n), trough concentration (C\n), and area under the plasma\nconcentration versus time curve at steady state (AUC\n) of pembrolizumab increased\ndose proportionally in the dose range of 2 to 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks.\nDistribution\nThe geometric mean value (CV%) for volume of distribution at steady state is 6.0 L\n(20%).\nElimination\nPembrolizumab clearance (CV%) is approximately 23% lower [geometric mean, 195\nmL/day (40%)] at steady state than that after the first dose [252 mL/day (37%)]; this\ndecrease in clearance with time is not considered clinically important. The terminal half-\nlife (t\n) is 22 days (32%).\nSpecific Populations\nThe following factors had no clinically important effect on the CL of pembrolizumab: age\n(range: 15 to 94 years), sex, race (89% White), renal impairment (eGFR \u226515\nmL/min/1.73 m ), mild to moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin \u22643 times ULN and\nany AST), or tumor burden. The impact of severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3\ntimes ULN and any AST) on the pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab is unknown.\nmax\nmin\nss\n1/2\n2\nPediatric Patients: Pembrolizumab concentrations with weight-based dosing at 2 mg/kg\nevery 3 weeks in pediatric patients (10 months to 17 years) are comparable to those of\nadults at the same dose.\n12.6 Immunogenicity\nThe observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) is highly dependent on the\nsensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude\nmeaningful comparisons of the incidence of ADA in the studies described in this section\nwith the incidence of ADA in other studies, including those of KEYTRUDA or of other\npembrolizumab products.\nTrough levels of pembrolizumab interfere with the electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay\nresults; therefore, a subset analysis was performed in the KEYTRUDA-treated patients\nwith a pembrolizumab concentration below the drug tolerance level of the ADA assay.\nIn clinical studies in patients treated with KEYTRUDA at a dosage of 2 mg/kg every 3\nweeks, 200 mg every 3 weeks, or 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks, 27 (2.1%) of 1,289\nevaluable patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-pembrolizumab antibodies\nof whom 6 (0.5%) patients had neutralizing antibodies against pembrolizumab. There\nwere no identified clinically significant effects of ADA on pembrolizumab\npharmacokinetics or on the risk of infusion reactions. Because of the low occurrence of\nADA, the effect of these ADA on the effectiveness of KEYTRUDA is unknown.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nNo studies have been performed to test the potential of pembrolizumab for\ncarcinogenicity or genotoxicity.\nFertility studies have not been conducted with pembrolizumab. In 1-month and 6-month\nrepeat-dose toxicology studies in monkeys, there were no notable effects in the male\nand female reproductive organs; however, most animals in these studies were not\nsexually mature.\n13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nIn animal models, inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling increased the severity of some\ninfections and enhanced inflammatory responses. Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected\nPD-1 knockout mice exhibit markedly decreased survival compared with wild-type\ncontrols, which correlated with increased bacterial proliferation and inflammatory\nresponses in these animals. PD-1 blockade using a primate anti-PD-1 antibody was also\nshown to exacerbate M. tuberculosis infection in rhesus macaques. PD-1 and PD-L1\nknockout mice and mice receiving PD-L1-blocking antibody have also shown decreased\nsurvival following infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Administration of\npembrolizumab in chimpanzees with naturally occurring chronic hepatitis B infection\nresulted in two out of four animals with significantly increased levels of serum ALT, AST,\nand GGT, which persisted for at least 1 month after discontinuation of pembrolizumab.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 Melanoma\nIpilimumab-Naive Melanoma\nThe efficacy of KEYTRUDA was investigated in KEYNOTE-006 (NCT01866319), a\nrandomized (1:1:1), open-label, multicenter, active-controlled trial in 834 patients.\nPatients were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA at a dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously\nevery 2 weeks or 10 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks until disease progression or\nunacceptable toxicity or to ipilimumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses\nunless discontinued earlier for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients\nwith disease progression could receive additional doses of treatment unless disease\nprogression was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention,\noccurred with a decline in performance status, or was confirmed at 4 to 6 weeks with\nrepeat imaging. Randomization was stratified by line of therapy (0 vs. 1), ECOG PS (0 vs.\n1), and PD-L1 expression (\u22651% of tumor cells [positive] vs. <1% of tumor cells\n[negative]) according to an investigational use only (IUO) assay. Key eligibility criteria\nwere unresectable or metastatic melanoma; no prior ipilimumab; and no more than one\nprior systemic treatment for metastatic melanoma. Patients with BRAF V600E mutation-\npositive melanoma were not required to have received prior BRAF inhibitor therapy.\nPatients with autoimmune disease; a medical condition that required\nimmunosuppression; previous severe hypersensitivity to other monoclonal antibodies;\nand HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, were ineligible. Assessment of tumor status\nwas performed at 12 weeks, then every 6 weeks through Week 48, followed by every\n12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall survival (OS)\nand progression-free survival (PFS; as assessed by blinded independent central review\n[BICR] using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST v1.1, modified to\nfollow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ]).\nAdditional efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration\nof response (DoR).\nThe study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 18 to 89);\n60% male; 98% White; 66% had no prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease; 69%\nECOG PS of 0; 80% had PD-L1 positive melanoma, 18% had PD-L1 negative melanoma,\nand 2% had unknown PD-L1 status using the IUO assay; 65% had M1c stage disease;\n68% with normal LDH; 36% with reported BRAF mutation-positive melanoma; and 9%\nwith a history of brain metastases. Among patients with BRAF mutation-positive\nmelanoma, 139 (46%) were previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor.\nThe study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS and PFS for patients\nrandomized to KEYTRUDA as compared to ipilimumab. Among the 91 patients\nrandomized to KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks with an objective response,\nresponse durations ranged from 1.4+ to 8.1+ months.

The treatment arms consisted of KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg\nintravenously every 3 weeks or investigator's choice of any of the following\nchemotherapy regimens: dacarbazine 1000 mg/m  intravenously every 3 weeks (26%),\ntemozolomide 200 mg/m  orally once daily for 5 days every 28 days (25%), carboplatin\nAUC 6 mg/mL/min intravenously plus paclitaxel 225 mg/m  intravenously every 3 weeks\nfor four cycles then carboplatin AUC of 5 mg/mL/min plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m  every 3\nweeks (25%), paclitaxel 175 mg/m  intravenously every 3 weeks (16%), or carboplatin\nAUC 5 or 6 mg/mL/min intravenously every 3 weeks (8%). Randomization was stratified\nby ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), LDH levels (normal vs. elevated [\u2265110% ULN]) and BRAF V600\nmutation status (wild-type [WT] or V600E). The trial included patients with unresectable\nor metastatic melanoma with progression of disease; refractory to two or more doses\nof ipilimumab (3 mg/kg or higher) and, if BRAF V600 mutation-positive, a BRAF or MEK\ninhibitor; and disease progression within 24 weeks following the last dose of ipilimumab.\nThe trial excluded patients with uveal melanoma and active brain metastasis. Patients\nreceived KEYTRUDA until unacceptable toxicity; disease progression that was\nsymptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, occurred with a\ndecline in performance status, or was confirmed at 4 to 6 weeks with repeat imaging;\nwithdrawal of consent; or physician's decision to stop therapy for the patient.\nBased on the final analysis with an additional follow-up of 9 months (total of 383 deaths as pre-\nspecified in the protocol)\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nAssessment of tumor status was performed at 12 weeks after randomization, then\nevery 6 weeks through week 48, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. Patients on\nchemotherapy who experienced progression of disease were offered KEYTRUDA. The\nmajor efficacy outcomes were PFS as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1, modified to\nfollow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ,\nand OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures were confirmed ORR as assessed by\nBICR per RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a\nmaximum of 5 target lesions per organ, and DoR.\nThe study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 15 to 89),\n43% age 65 or older; 61% male; 98% White; and 55% ECOG PS of 0 and 45% ECOG PS\nof 1. Twenty-three percent of patients were BRAF V600 mutation positive, 40% had\nelevated LDH at baseline, 82% had M1c disease, and 73% had two or more prior\ntherapies for advanced or metastatic disease.\nThe study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients\nrandomized to KEYTRUDA as compared to control arm. There was no statistically\nsignificant difference between KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg and chemotherapy or between\nKEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg and chemotherapy in the OS analysis in which 55% of the patients\nwho had been randomized to receive chemotherapy had crossed over to receive\nKEYTRUDA. Among the 38 patients randomized to KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg with an objective\nresponse, response durations ranged from 1.3+ to 11.5+ months.

Patients were randomized to KEYTRUDA\n200 mg or the pediatric (\u226512 years old) dose of KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg intravenously (up\nto a maximum of 200 mg) every three weeks or placebo for up to one year until disease\nrecurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by AJCC 8\n edition T\nStage (>2.0-4.0 mm with ulceration vs. >4.0 mm without ulceration vs. >4.0 mm with\nulceration). Patients must not have been previously treated for melanoma beyond\ncomplete surgical resection for their melanoma prior to study entry. The major efficacy\noutcome measure was investigator-assessed recurrence-free survival (RFS) (defined as\nHazard ratio (KEYTRUDA compared to chemotherapy) based on the\nstratified Cox proportional hazard model\nWith additional follow-up of 18 months after the PFS analysis\nNot statistically significant compared to multiplicity adjusted significance\nlevel of 0.01\nth\nthe time between the date of randomization and the date of first recurrence [local, in-\ntransit or regional lymph nodes or distant recurrence] or death, whichever occurred\nfirst). New primary melanomas were excluded from the definition of RFS. Distant\nmetastasis-free survival (DMFS), defined as a spread of tumor to distant organs or\ndistant lymph nodes, was an additional efficacy outcome measure. Patients underwent\nimaging every six months for one year from randomization, every 6 months from years\n2 to 4, and then once in year 5 from randomization or until recurrence, whichever came\nfirst.\nThe study population characteristics were: median age of 61 years (range: 16 to 87),\n39% age 65 or older; 60% male; 98% White; and 93% ECOG PS of 0 and 7% ECOG PS\nof 1.

Thirty percent had Stage II and 70% had Stage III disease; 33% had TPS \u226550%\nand 67% had TPS <50%; 43% had tumors with squamous histology and 57% had\ntumors with non-squamous histology; 31% were from the East Asian region.\nEighty-one percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum-containing\nchemotherapy arm received definitive surgery compared to 76% of patients in the\nplacebo in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy arm.\nThe trial demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS and EFS for patients\nrandomized to KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy\nfollowed by KEYTRUDA as a single agent compared with patients randomized to placebo\nin combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy followed by placebo alone.\nTable 67 and Figure 10 summarize the efficacy results for KEYNOTE-671.\nTable 67: Efficacy Results in KEYNOTE-671\nEndpoint\nKEYTRUDA\n200 mg every 3 weeks\nwith\nchemotherapy/KEYTRUDA\nn=397\nPlacebo with\nchemotherapy/Placebo\nn=400\nOS\n  Number of\npatients with event\n(%)\n110 (28%)\n144 (36%)\n  Median in\nmonths  (95% CI)\nNR (NR, NR)\n52.4 (45.7, NR)\n  Hazard ratio\n(95% CI)\n0.72 (0.56, 0.93)\n  p-Value\n0.0103\nEFS\n  Number of\npatients with event\n139 (35%)\n205 (51%)\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021,\u00a7\nNR = not reached\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u00b6\n(%)\n  Median in\nmonths  (95% CI)\nNR (34.1, NR)\n17.0 (14.3, 22.0)\n  Hazard ratio\n(95% CI)\n0.58 (0.46, 0.72)\n  p-Value\n<0.0001\nFigure 10: Kaplan-Meier Curve for Overall Survival in KEYNOTE-671\nBased on Kaplan-Meier estimates\nBased on Cox regression model with treatment as a covariate stratified by stage,\ntumor PD-L1 expression, histology, and geographic region\nBased on stratified log-rank test\nCompared to a two-sided p-Value boundary of 0.0109\nCompared to a two-sided p-Value boundary of 0.0092\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021,\u00b6\nThe trial demonstrated a statistically significant difference in pCR rate (18.1% vs. 4.0%;\np<0.0001) and mPR rate (30.2% vs. 11.0%; p<0.0001).\nAdjuvant treatment of resected NSCLC\nThe efficacy of KEYTRUDA was investigated in KEYNOTE-091 (NCT02504372), a\nmulticenter, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 1177 patients\nwith completely resected Stage IB (T2a \u22654 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC by AJCC 7th edition.\nPatients had not received neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Adjuvant\nchemotherapy up to 4 cycles was optional. Patients were ineligible if they had active\nautoimmune disease, were on chronic immunosuppressive agents, or had a history of\ninterstitial lung disease or pneumonitis. Randomization was stratified by stage (IB vs. II\nvs. IIIA), receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs. no), PD-L1 status (TPS <1%\n[negative] vs. TPS 1-49% vs. TPS \u226550%), and geographic region (Western Europe vs.\nEastern Europe vs. Asia vs. Rest of World). Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive\nKEYTRUDA 200 mg or placebo intravenously every 3 weeks.\nTreatment continued until RECIST v1.1-defined disease recurrence as determined by the\ninvestigator, unacceptable toxicity or up to one year. Tumor assessments were\nconducted every 12 weeks for the first year, then every 6 months for years 2 to 3, and\nthen annually through year 5. After year 5, imaging was performed as per local standard\nof care. The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed disease-free\nsurvival (DFS). An additional efficacy outcome measure was OS.\nOf 1177 patients randomized, 1010 (86%) received adjuvant platinum-based\nchemotherapy following resection. Among these 1010 patients, the median age was 64\nyears (range: 35 to 84), 49% age 65 or older; 68% male; 77% White, 18% Asian; 86%\ncurrent or former smokers; and 39% with ECOG PS of 1. Eleven percent had Stage IB,\n57% had Stage II, and 31% had Stage IIIA disease. Thirty-nine percent had PD-L1 TPS\n<1% [negative], 33% had TPS 1-49%, and 28% had TPS \u226550%. Fifty-two percent were\nfrom Western Europe, 20% from Eastern Europe, 17% from Asia, and 11% from Rest\nof World.\nThe trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement\nin DFS in the overall population for patients randomized to the KEYTRUDA arm compared\nto patients randomized to the placebo arm. In an exploratory subgroup analysis of the\n167 patients (14%) who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, the DFS HR was 1.25\n(95% CI: 0.76, 2.05). OS results were not mature with only 42% of pre-specified OS\nevents in the overall population.\nTable 68 and Figure 11 summarize the efficacy results for KEYNOTE-091 in patients who\nreceived adjuvant chemotherapy.\nTable 68: Efficacy Results in KEYNOTE-091 for Patients\nWho Received Adjuvant Chemotherapy\nEndpoint\nKEYTRUDA\n200 mg every 3\nweeks\nn=506\nPlacebo\nn=504\nDFS\n  Number (%) of\npatients with event\n177 (35%)\n231 (46%)\nNR = not reached\n*\n  Median in months\n(95% CI)\n58.7\n(39.2, NR)\n34.9\n(28.6, NR)\n  Hazard ratio  (95%\nCI)\n0.73 (0.60, 0.89)\nFigure 11: Kaplan-Meier Curve for Disease-Free Survival in KEYNOTE-091 for\nPatients Who Received Adjuvant Chemotherapy\n14.3 Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer\nFirst-line treatment of metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC\nThe efficacy of KEYTRUDA was investigated in KEYNOTE-048 (NCT02358031), a\nrandomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial conducted in 882 patients\nwith metastatic HNSCC who had not previously received systemic therapy for metastatic\ndisease or with recurrent disease who were considered incurable by local therapies.\nPatients with active autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within two years\nof treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible.\nRandomization was stratified by tumor PD-L1 expression (TPS \u226550% or <50%)\nBased on the unstratified univariate Cox regression model\n*\naccording to the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit, HPV status according to p16 IHC\n(positive or negative), and ECOG PS (0 vs. 1). Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to one of\nthe following treatment arms:\nKEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks\nKEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks, carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min\nintravenously every 3 weeks or cisplatin 100 mg/m  intravenously every 3 weeks,\nand FU 1000 mg/m /day as a continuous intravenous infusion over 96 hours every 3\nweeks (maximum of 6 cycles of platinum and FU)\nCetuximab 400 mg/m  intravenously as the initial dose then 250 mg/m  intravenously\nonce weekly, carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously every 3 weeks or cisplatin\n100 mg/m  intravenously every 3 weeks, and FU 1000 mg/m /day as a continuous\nintravenous infusion over 96 hours every 3 weeks (maximum of 6 cycles of platinum\nand FU)\nTreatment with KEYTRUDA continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease\nas determined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months.\nAdministration of KEYTRUDA was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression\nif the patient was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the\ninvestigator. Assessment of tumor status was performed at Week 9 and then every 6\nweeks for the first year, followed by every 9 weeks through 24 months. A retrospective\nre-classification of patients' tumor PD-L1 status according to CPS using the PD-L1 IHC\n22C3 pharmDx kit was conducted using the tumor specimens used for randomization.\nThe main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR according\nto RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5\ntarget lesions per organ) sequentially tested in the subgroup of patients with CPS \u226520,\nthe subgroup of patients with CPS \u22651, and the overall population.\nThe study population characteristics were: median age of 61 years (range: 20 to 94),\n36% age 65 or older; 83% male; 73% White, 20% Asian and 2.4% Black; 61% had ECOG\nPS of 1; and 79% were former/current smokers. Twenty-two percent of patients'\ntumors were HPV-positive, 23% had PD-L1 TPS \u226550%, and 95% had Stage IV disease\n(Stage IVA 19%, Stage IVB 6%, and Stage IVC 70%). Eighty-five percent of patients'\ntumors had PD-L1 expression of CPS \u22651 and 43% had CPS \u226520.\nThe trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients\nrandomized to KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy compared to those\nrandomized to cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy at a pre-specified interim\nanalysis in the overall population.

In the absence of disease progression or\nunacceptable toxicity, KEYTRUDA was continued for up to 2 years.\n*\nMedian follow-up time of 9.7 months\nBased on patients (n=24) with a response by\nindependent review\n\u2020\n2\n2\nGemcitabine 1000 mg/m  on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle with cisplatin 70 mg/m\nor carboplatin (AUC = 4.5 or 5) on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Treatment was continued\nuntil disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for up to 6 cycles.\nRandomization was stratified by cisplatin eligibility, PD-L1 expression, and presence of\nliver metastases.\nThe median age was 69 years (range: 22 to 91); 77% were male; 67% were White, 22%\nwere Asian, 1% were Black or African American, and 10% were unknown or other; 12%\nwere Hispanic or Latino. Patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 (49%), 1\n(47%), or 2 (3%). Forty-seven percent of patients had a documented baseline HbA1c of\n<5.7%. At baseline, 95% of patients had metastatic urothelial cancer, including 72% with\nvisceral and 22% with liver metastases, and 5% had locally advanced urothelial cancer.\nEighty-five percent of patients had urothelial carcinoma (UC) histology including 6% with\nUC mixed squamous differentiation and 2% with UC mixed other histologic variants.\nForty-six percent of patients were considered cisplatin-ineligible and 54% were\nconsidered cisplatin-eligible at time of randomization.\nThe major efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR according\nto RECIST v1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures included ORR as assessed by\nBICR.\nThe trial demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS, PFS, and ORR for\npatients randomized to KEYTRUDA in combination with enfortumab vedotin as compared\nto platinum-based chemotherapy.

Patients with active CNS\nmetastases, ongoing sensory or motor neuropathy Grade \u22652, or uncontrolled diabetes\ndefined as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) \u22658% or HbA1c \u22657% with associated diabetes\nsymptoms were excluded from participating in the study.\nPatients in the dose escalation cohort (n=5), Cohort A (n=40), and Cohort K (n=76)\nreceived enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg as an IV infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1\nand 8 of a 21-day cycle followed by KEYTRUDA 200 mg as an IV infusion on Day 1 of a\n21-day cycle approximately 30 minutes after enfortumab vedotin. Patients were treated\nuntil disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\nA total of 121 patients received KEYTRUDA in combination with enfortumab vedotin. The\nmedian age was 71 years (range: 51 to 91); 74% were male; 85% were White, 5% were\nBlack, 4% were Asian and 6% were other, unknown or not reported. Ten percent of\npatients were Hispanic or Latino. Forty-five percent of patients had an ECOG\nperformance status of 1 and 15% had an ECOG performance status of 2. Forty-seven\npercent of patients had a documented baseline HbA1c of <5.7%. Reasons for cisplatin-\nineligibility included: 60% with baseline creatinine clearance of 30-59 mL/min, 10% with\nECOG PS of 2, 13% with Grade 2 or greater hearing loss, and 16% with more than one\ncisplatin-ineligibility criteria.\nAt baseline, 97.5% of patients had metastatic urothelial cancer and 2.5% of patients had\nlocally advanced urothelial cancer. Thirty-seven percent of patients had upper tract\ndisease. Eighty-four percent of patients had visceral metastasis at baseline, including\n22% with liver metastases. Thirty-nine percent of patients had TCC histology; 13% had\nTCC with squamous differentiation, and 48% had TCC with other histologic variants.\nThe major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR\naccording to RECIST v1.1.\nThe median follow-up time for the dose escalation cohort + Cohort A was 44.7 months\n(range 0.7 to 52.4) and for Cohort K was 14.8 months (range: 0.6 to 26.2).\nEfficacy results are presented in Table 75 below.\nTable 75: Efficacy Results in KEYNOTE-869, Combined\nDose Escalation Cohort, Cohort A, and Cohort K\nEndpoint\nKEYTRUDA in combination\nwith Enfortumab Vedotin\nn=121\n  Confirmed ORR (95% CI)\n68% (58.7, 76.0)\n    Complete response rate\n12%\n    Partial response rate\n55%\nThe median duration of response for the dose escalation cohort + Cohort A was 22.1\nmonths (range: 1.0+ to 46.3+) and for Cohort K was not reached (range: 1.2 to 24.1+).\nPlatinum-Ineligible Patients with Urothelial Carcinoma\nThe efficacy of KEYTRUDA was investigated in KEYNOTE-052 (NCT02335424), a\nmulticenter, open-label, single-arm trial in 370 patients with locally advanced or\nmetastatic urothelial carcinoma who had one or more comorbidities, including patients\nwho were not eligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy. The trial excluded\npatients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required\nimmunosuppression. Patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks until\nunacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with initial radiographic disease\nprogression could receive additional doses of treatment during confirmation of\nprogression unless disease progression was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive,\nrequired urgent intervention, or occurred with a decline in performance status. Patients\nwithout disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. Tumor response\nassessments were performed at 9 weeks after the first dose, then every 6 weeks for\nthe first year, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome\nmeasures were ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified\nto follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ.\nThe study population characteristics were: median age of 74 years; 77% male; and 89%\nWhite. Eighty-seven percent had M1 disease, and 13% had M0 disease. Eighty-one\npercent had a primary tumor in the lower tract, and 19% of patients had a primary\ntumor in the upper tract. Eighty-five percent of patients had visceral metastases,\nincluding 21% with liver metastases. Fifty percent of patients had baseline creatinine\nclearance of <60 mL/min, 32% had ECOG PS of 2, 9% had ECOG PS of 2 and baseline\ncreatinine clearance of <60 mL/min, and 9% had one or more of Class III heart failure,\nGrade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy, and Grade 2 or greater hearing loss. Ninety\npercent of patients were treatment na\u00efve, and 10% received prior adjuvant or\nneoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy.\nThe median follow-up time for 370 patients treated with KEYTRUDA was 11.4 months\n(range 0.1 to 63.8 months). Efficacy results are summarized in Table 76.\nTable 76: Efficacy Results in KEYNOTE-052\nEndpoint\nKEYTRUDA\n200 mg every 3 weeks\nAll Subjects\nn=370\n+ Denotes ongoing response\nObjective Response Rate\n  ORR (95% CI)\n29% (24, 34)\n    Complete response rate\n10%\n    Partial response rate\n20%\nDuration of Response\n  Median in months (range)\n33.4\n(1.4+, 60.7+)\nPlatinum-Eligible Patients with Previously Untreated Urothelial Carcinoma\nThe efficacy of KEYTRUDA for the first-line treatment of platinum-eligible patients with\nlocally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma was investigated in KEYNOTE-361\n(NCT02853305), a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled study in 1010\npreviously untreated patients. The safety and efficacy of KEYTRUDA in combination with\nplatinum-based chemotherapy for previously untreated patients with locally advanced or\nmetastatic urothelial carcinoma has not been established.\nThe study compared KEYTRUDA with or without platinum-based chemotherapy (i.e.,\ncisplatin or carboplatin with gemcitabine) to platinum-based chemotherapy alone. Among\nthe patients receiving KEYTRUDA plus platinum-based chemotherapy, 44% received\ncisplatin and 56% received carboplatin.\nThe study did not meet its major efficacy outcome measures of improved PFS or OS in\nthe KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy arm compared to the chemotherapy-alone arm.\nAdditional efficacy endpoints, including improvement of OS in the KEYTRUDA\nmonotherapy arm, could not be formally tested.\nPreviously Treated Urothelial Carcinoma\nThe efficacy of KEYTRUDA was investigated in KEYNOTE-045 (NCT02256436), a\nmulticenter, randomized (1:1), active-controlled trial in 542 patients with locally advanced\nor metastatic urothelial carcinoma with disease progression on or after platinum-\ncontaining chemotherapy. The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a\nmedical condition that required immunosuppression.\nPatients were randomized to receive either KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=270)\nor investigator's choice of any of the following chemotherapy regimens all given\nintravenously every 3 weeks (n=272): paclitaxel 175 mg/m (n=90), docetaxel 75\nmg/m (n=92), or vinflunine 320 mg/m (n=90). Treatment continued until unacceptable\ntoxicity or disease progression. Patients with initial radiographic disease progression\ncould receive additional doses of treatment during confirmation of progression unless\ndisease progression was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent\nintervention, or occurred with a decline in performance status. Patients without disease\nprogression could be treated for up to 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was\nperformed at 9 weeks after randomization, then every 6 weeks through the first year,\nfollowed by every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcomes were OS and PFS\nas assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target\nlesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Additional efficacy outcome\nmeasures were ORR as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a\nmaximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, and DoR.\nThe study population characteristics were: median age of 66 years (range: 26 to 88),\n58% age 65 or older; 74% male; 72% White and 23% Asian; 42% ECOG PS of 0 and\n56% ECOG PS of 1; and 96% M1 disease and 4% M0 disease. Eighty-seven percent of\npatients had visceral metastases, including 34% with liver metastases. Eighty-six percent\nhad a primary tumor in the lower tract and 14% had a primary tumor in the upper tract.\nFifteen percent of patients had disease progression following prior platinum-containing\nneoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Twenty-one percent had received 2 or more\nprior systemic regimens in the metastatic setting. Seventy-six percent of patients\nreceived prior cisplatin, 23% had prior carboplatin, and 1% were treated with other\nplatinum-based regimens.\nThe study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS and ORR for\npatients randomized to KEYTRUDA as compared to chemotherapy. There was no\nstatistically significant difference between KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy with respect to\nPFS. The median follow-up time for this trial was 9.0 months (range: 0.2 to 20.8\nmonths).

BCG-unresponsive high-risk NMIBC was defined as\npersistent disease despite adequate BCG therapy, disease recurrence after an initial\ntumor-free state following adequate BCG therapy, or T1 disease following a single\ninduction course of BCG. Adequate BCG therapy was defined as administration of at\nleast five of six doses of an initial induction course plus either of: at least two of three\ndoses of maintenance therapy or at least two of six doses of a second induction course.\nPrior to treatment, all patients had undergone transurethral resection of bladder tumor\n(TURBT) to remove all resectable disease (Ta and T1 components). Residual CIS (Tis\ncomponents) not amenable to complete resection was allowed. The trial excluded\npatients with muscle invasive (i.e., T2, T3, T4) locally advanced non-resectable or\nmetastatic urothelial carcinoma, concurrent extra-vesical (i.e., urethra, ureter or renal\npelvis) non-muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium, or autoimmune\ndisease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression.\nPatients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity,\npersistent or recurrent high-risk NMIBC, or progressive disease. Assessment of tumor\nstatus was performed every 12 weeks for two years and then every 24 weeks for three\nyears, and patients without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months.\nThe major efficacy outcome measures were complete response (as defined by negative\nresults for cystoscopy [with TURBT/biopsies as applicable], urine cytology, and\ncomputed tomography urography [CTU] imaging) and duration of response.\nThe study population characteristics were: median age of 73 years (range: 44 to 92);\n44% age \u226575; 84% male; 67% White; and 73% and 27% with an ECOG performance\nstatus of 0 or 1, respectively. Tumor pattern at study entry was CIS with T1 (13%), CIS\nwith high grade TA (25%), and CIS (63%). Baseline high-risk NMIBC disease status was\n27% persistent and 73% recurrent. The median number of prior instillations of BCG was\n12.\nThe median follow-up time was 28.0 months (range: 4.6 to 40.5 months).

All trials excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical\ncondition that required immunosuppression. Regardless of histology, MSI or MMR tumor\nstatus was determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR; local or central) or\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC; local or central), respectively.\nKEYNOTE-164 enrolled 124 patients with advanced MSI-H or dMMR colorectal cancer\n(CRC) that progressed following treatment with fluoropyrimidine and either oxaliplatin\nor irinotecan +/- anti-VEGF/EGFR mAb-based therapy.\nKEYNOTE-158 enrolled 373 patients with advanced MSI-H or dMMR non-colorectal\ncancers (non-CRC) who had disease progression following prior therapy. Patients\nwere either prospectively enrolled with MSI-H/dMMR tumors (Cohort K) or\nretrospectively identified in one of 10 solid tumor cohorts (Cohorts A-J).\nKEYNOTE-051 enrolled 7 pediatric patients with MSI-H or dMMR cancers.\nAdult patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks (pediatric patients received 2\nmg/kg every 3 weeks) until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or a maximum of\n24 months.

In\nKEYNOTE-051, assessment of tumor status was performed every 8 weeks for 24\nweeks, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were\nORR and DoR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a\nmaximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ in\nKEYNOTE-158) and as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1 in\nKEYNOTE-051.\nIn KEYNOTE-164 and KEYNOTE-158, the study population characteristics were median\nage of 60 years, 36% age 65 or older; 44% male; 78% White, 14% Asian, 4% American\nIndian or Alaska Native, and 3% Black; and 45% ECOG PS of 0 and 55% ECOG PS of 1.\nNinety-two percent of patients had metastatic disease and 4% had locally advanced,\nunresectable disease. Thirty-seven percent of patients received one prior line of therapy\nand 61% received two or more prior lines of therapy.\nIn KEYNOTE-051, the study population characteristics were median age of 11 years\n(range: 3 to 16); 71% female; 86% White and 14% Asian; and 57% had a\nLansky/Karnofsky Score of 100. Seventy-one percent of patients had Stage IV and 14%\nhad Stage III disease. Fifty-seven percent of patients received one prior line of therapy\nand 29% received two prior lines of therapy.\nDiscordant results were observed between local MSI-H or dMMR tests and central\ntesting among patients enrolled in Cohort K of KEYNOTE-158. Among 104 tumor\nsamples that were MSI-H or dMMR by local testing and also tested using the\nFoundationOne CDx (F1CDx) test, 59 (56.7%) were MSI-H and 45 (43.3%) were not\nMSI-H. Among 169 tumor samples that were MSI-H or dMMR by local testing and also\ntested using the VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel, 105 (62.1%) were dMMR and 64 (37.9%)\nwere pMMR.\nEfficacy results are summarized in Tables 79 and 80.\nTable 79: Efficacy Results for Patients with\nMSI-H/dMMR Cancer\nEndpoint\nKEYTRUDA \nn=504\n+ Denotes ongoing response\n*\nObjective Response\nRate\n  ORR (95% CI)\n33.3% (29.2, 37.6)\n    Complete response\nrate\n10.3%\n    Partial response rate\n23.0%\nDuration of Response\nn=168\n    Median in months\n(range)\n63.2 (1.9+, 63.9+)\n    % with duration \u226512\nmonths\n77%\n    % with duration \u226536\nmonths\n39%\n\u00ae\n*\nMedian follow-up time of 20.1 months (range 0.1 to 71.4\n\u2020\n*\n\u2020\nTable 80: Response by Tumor Type\nObjective\nResponse Rate\nDuration of\nResponse\nrange\nN\nn (%)\n95% CI\n(months)\n+ Denotes ongoing response\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\nCRC\n124\n42 (34%)\n(26%,\n43%)\n(4.4, 58.5+)\nNon-CRC\n380\n126\n(33%)\n(28%,\n38%)\n(1.9+,\n63.9+)\n  Endometrial cancer\n94\n47 (50%)\n(40%,\n61%)\n(2.9, 63.2)\n  Gastric or GE junction\ncancer\n51\n20 (39%)\n(26%,\n54%)\n(1.9+,\n63.0+)\n  Small intestinal cancer\n27\n16 (59%)\n(39%,\n78%)\n(3.7+,\n57.3+)\n  Brain cancer\n27\n1 (4%)\n(0%, 19%)\n18.9\n  Ovarian cancer\n25\n8 (32%)\n(15%,\n54%)\n(4.2, 56.6+)\n  Biliary cancer\n22\n9 (41%)\n(21%,\n64%)\n(6.2, 49.0+)\n  Pancreatic cancer\n22\n4 (18%) (5%, 40%) (8.1, 24.3+)\n  Sarcoma\n14\n3 (21%) (5%, 51%)\n(35.4+,\n57.2+)\n  Breast cancer\n13\n1 (8%)\n(0%,36%)\n24.3+\n  Other\n13\n4 (31%) (9%, 61%)\n(6.2+,\n32.3+)\n  Cervical cancer\n11\n1 (9%)\n(0%, 41%)\n63.9+\n  Neuroendocrine cancer\n11\n1 (9%)\n(0%, 41%)\n13.3\n  Prostate cancer\n8\n1 (13%) (0%, 53%)\n24.5+\n  Adrenocortical cancer\n7\n1 (14%) (0%, 58%)\n4.2\n  Mesothelioma\n7\n0 (0%)\n(0%, 41%)\n  Thyroid cancer\n7\n1 (14%) (0%, 58%)\n8.2\n  Small cell lung cancer\n6\n2 (33%) (4%, 78%) (20.0, 47.5)\n  Bladder cancer\n6\n3 (50%)\n(12%,\n88%)\n(35.6+,\n57.5+)\n  Salivary cancer\n5\n2 (40%) (5%, 85%)\n(42.6+,\n57.8+)\n  Renal cell cancer\n4\n1 (25%) (0%, 81%)\n22.0\nmonths)\nOf the 7 pediatric patients from KEYNOTE-051, 1 patient\nhad a radiographic complete response after initial growth\nof their tumor but is not reflected in the results.\nResults include patients in Cohort K of KEYNOTE-158 that were later\ndetermined to be pMMR or not MSI-H by central testing\nIncludes 6 pediatric patients with brain cancer\nIn addition to the 1 adult responder, 1 pediatric patient had a\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u2021\n\u00a7\nExploratory analysis by TMB\nIn an exploratory analysis performed in 138 patients (Cohort K of KEYNOTE-158) who\nwere tested retrospectively for tumor mutation burden (TMB) using an FDA-approved\ntest, 45 (33%) had tumors with TMB score of <10 mut/Mb; ORR in these 45 patients\nwas 6.7% (95% CI: 1.4, 18.3).

Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks. Patients\nrandomized to chemotherapy were offered KEYTRUDA at the time of disease\nprogression. The main efficacy outcome measures were PFS (as assessed by BICR\naccording to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a\nmaximum of 5 target lesions per organ) and OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures\nwere ORR and DoR.\nA total of 307 patients were enrolled and randomized to KEYTRUDA (n=153) or\nchemotherapy (n=154). The baseline characteristics of these 307 patients were: median\nage of 63 years (range: 24 to 93), 47% age 65 or older; 50% male; 75% White and 16%\nAsian; 52% had an ECOG PS of 0 and 48% had an ECOG PS of 1; and 27% received\nradiographic complete response after initial growth of their tumor.\nIncludes tumor type (n): anal (3), HNSCC (1), nasopharyngeal (1),\nretroperitoneal (1), testicular (1), vaginal (1), vulvar (1), appendiceal\nadenocarcinoma, NOS (1), hepatocellular carcinoma (1), and carcinoma\nof unknown origin (1).

All patients were required to have tumor specimens for PD-\nL1 testing at a central laboratory; PD-L1 status was determined using the PD-L1 IHC\n22C3 pharmDx kit. Patients with a history of non-infectious pneumonitis that required\nsteroids or current pneumonitis, active autoimmune disease, or a medical condition that\nrequired immunosuppression were ineligible.\nPatients were randomized (1:1) to receive either KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks or\ninvestigator's choice of any of the following chemotherapy regimens, all given\nintravenously: paclitaxel 80-100 mg/m  on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 4-week cycle,\ndocetaxel 75 mg/m  every 3 weeks, or irinotecan 180 mg/m  every 2 weeks.\nRandomization was stratified by tumor histology (esophageal squamous cell carcinoma\n[ESCC] vs. esophageal adenocarcinoma [EAC]/Siewert type I EAC of the\ngastroesophageal junction [GEJ]), and geographic region (Asia vs. ex-Asia). Treatment\nwith KEYTRUDA or chemotherapy continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease\nprogression. Patients randomized to KEYTRUDA were permitted to continue beyond the\nfirst RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of\n5 target lesions per organ)-defined disease progression if clinically stable until the first\nradiographic evidence of disease progression was confirmed at least 4 weeks later with\nrepeat imaging. Patients treated with KEYTRUDA without disease progression could be\ntreated for up to 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9\nweeks. The major efficacy outcome measure was OS evaluated in the following co-\nprimary populations: patients with ESCC, patients with tumors expressing PD-L1 CPS\n\u226510, and all randomized patients. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS, ORR,\nand DoR, according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions\nand a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, as assessed by BICR.\nA total of 628 patients were enrolled and randomized to KEYTRUDA (n=314) or\ninvestigator's treatment of choice (n=314). Of these 628 patients, 167 (27%) had ESCC\nthat expressed PD-L1 with a CPS \u226510. Of these 167 patients, 85 patients were\nrandomized to KEYTRUDA and 82 patients to investigator's treatment of choice\n[paclitaxel (n=50), docetaxel (n=19), or irinotecan (n=13)]. The baseline characteristics\nof these 167 patients were: median age of 65 years (range: 33 to 80), 51% age 65 or\nolder; 84% male; 32% White and 68% Asian; 38% had an ECOG PS of 0 and 62% had an\nECOG PS of 1. Ninety percent had M1 disease and 10% had M0 disease. Prior to\nenrollment, 99% of patients had received platinum-based treatment and 84% had also\nreceived treatment with a fluoropyrimidine. Thirty-three percent of patients received\nprior treatment with a taxane.\n2\n2\n2\nThe observed OS hazard ratio was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.96) in patients with ESCC, 0.70\n(95% CI: 0.52, 0.94) in patients with tumors expressing PD-L1 CPS \u226510, and 0.89 (95%\nCI: 0.75, 1.05) in all randomized patients. On further examination in patients whose\nESCC tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS \u226510), an improvement in OS was observed among\npatients randomized to KEYTRUDA as compared with chemotherapy.

With the exception of the number of prior\nlines of treatment, the eligibility criteria were similar to and the dosage regimen identical\nto KEYNOTE-181.\nThe major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR according to RECIST v1.1,\nmodified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions\nper organ, as assessed by BICR.\nAmong the 121 patients enrolled, 29% (n=35) had ESCC that expressed PD-L1 CPS\n\u226510. The baseline characteristics of these 35 patients were: median age of 65 years\n(range: 47 to 81), 51% age 65 or older; 71% male; 26% White and 69% Asian; 40% had\nan ECOG PS of 0 and 60% had an ECOG PS of 1. One hundred percent had M1 disease.\nThe ORR in the 35 patients with ESCC expressing PD-L1 was 20% (95% CI: 8, 37).\nAmong the 7 responding patients, the DoR ranged from 4.2 to 25.1+ months, with 5\npatients (71%) having responses of 6 months or longer and 3 patients (57%) having\nresponses of 12 months or longer.\n14.11 Cervical Cancer\nFIGO 2014 Stage III-IVA Cervical Cancer with Chemoradiotherapy\nThe efficacy of KEYTRUDA in combination with CRT (cisplatin and external beam radiation\ntherapy [EBRT] followed by brachytherapy [BT]) was investigated in KEYNOTE-A18\n(NCT04221945), a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that\nenrolled 1060 patients with cervical cancer who had not previously received any\ndefinitive surgery, radiation, or systemic therapy for cervical cancer. There were 596\npatients with FIGO 2014 Stage III-IVA (tumor involvement of the lower vagina with or\nwithout extension onto pelvic sidewall or hydronephrosis/non-functioning kidney or has\nspread to adjacent pelvic organs) with either node-positive or node-negative disease,\nand 462 patients with FIGO 2014 Stage IB2-IIB (tumor lesions >4 cm or clinically visible\nlesions that have spread beyond the uterus but have not extended onto the pelvic wall\nor to the lower third of vagina) with node-positive disease; two patients had FIGO 2014\nStage IVB disease. Randomization was stratified by planned type of EBRT (Intensity-\nmodulated radiation therapy [IMRT] or volumetric modulated arc therapy [VMAT] vs.\nnon-IMRT and non-VMAT), stage at screening of cervical cancer (FIGO 2014 Stage IB2-\nIIB vs. FIGO 2014 Stage III-IVA), and planned total radiotherapy dose (EBRT +\nbrachytherapy dose of <70 Gy vs. \u226570 Gy as per equivalent dose [EQD2]).\nPatients were randomized (1:1) to one of two treatment arms:\nKEYTRUDA 200 mg IV every 3 weeks (5 cycles) concurrent with cisplatin 40 mg/m  IV\nweekly (5 cycles, an optional sixth infusion could be administered per local practice),\nand radiotherapy (EBRT followed by BT), followed by KEYTRUDA 400 mg IV every 6\nweeks (15 cycles)\nPlacebo IV every 3 weeks (5 cycles) concurrent with cisplatin 40 mg/m  IV weekly (5\ncycles, an optional sixth infusion could be administered per local practice), and\nradiotherapy (EBRT followed by BT), followed by placebo IV every 6 weeks (15 cycles)\nTreatment continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease as determined by\ninvestigator or unacceptable toxicity.\nAssessment of tumor status was performed every 12 weeks from completion of CRT\nfor the first two years, followed by every 24 weeks in year 3, and then annually. The\nmajor efficacy outcome measures were PFS as assessed by investigator according to\nRECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5\ntarget lesions per organ, or histopathologic confirmation, and OS.\nAmong the 596 patients with FIGO 2014 Stage III-IVA disease, the baseline\ncharacteristics were: median age of 52 years (range: 22 to 87), 17% age 65 or older;\n36% White, 34% Asian, 1% Black; 38% Hispanic or Latino; 68% ECOG PS 0 and 32%\nECOG PS 1; 93% with CPS \u22651; 70% had positive pelvic and/or positive para-aortic lymph\nnode(s) and 30% had neither positive pelvic nor para-aortic lymph node(s); 83% had\nsquamous cell carcinoma and 17% had non-squamous histology. Regarding radiation,\n85% of patients received IMRT or VMAT EBRT, and the median EQD2 dose was 87 Gy\n(range: 7 to 114).\nThe trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the overall\npopulation. In an exploratory subgroup analysis for the 462 patients (44%) with FIGO\n2014 Stage IB2-IIB disease, the PFS HR estimate was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.31),\n2\n2\nindicating that the PFS improvement in the overall population was primarily attributed to\nthe results seen in the subgroup of patients with FIGO 2014 Stage III-IVA disease. OS\ndata were not mature at the time of PFS analysis, with 10% deaths in the overall\npopulation.\nThe efficacy results in the exploratory subgroup analysis of 596 patients with FIGO 2014\nStage III-IVA disease are summarized in Table 86 and Figure 23.\nTable 86: Efficacy Results in KEYNOTE-A18 (Patients with\nFIGO 2014 Stage III-IVA Cervical Cancer)\nEndpoint\nKEYTRUDA\n200 mg every 3\nweeks and\n400 mg every 6\nweeks\nwith CRT\nn=293\nPlacebo\nwith CRT\nn=303\nCRT = Chemoradiotherapy\nNR = not reached\n*\nPFS by Investigator\n  Number of patients with\nevent (%)\n61 (21%)\n94 (31%)\n  Median in months (95%\nCI)\nNR (NR, NR)\nNR (18.8, NR)\n  12-month PFS rate (95%\nCI)\n81% (75, 85)\n70% (64, 76)\n  Hazard ratio  (95% CI)\n0.59 (0.43, 0.82)\nFigure 23: Kaplan-Meier Curve for Progression-Free Survival in KEYNOTE-A18\n(Patients with FIGO 2014 Stage III-IVA Cervical Cancer)\nBased on the unstratified Cox proportional hazard model\n*\nPersistent, Recurrent, or Metastatic Cervical Cancer\nThe efficacy of KEYTRUDA in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or paclitaxel and\ncarboplatin, with or without bevacizumab, was investigated in KEYNOTE-826\n(NCT03635567), a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that\nenrolled 617 patients with persistent, recurrent, or first-line metastatic cervical cancer\nwho had not been treated with chemotherapy except when used concurrently as a\nradio-sensitizing agent. Patients were enrolled regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression\nstatus. Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years\nof treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible.\nRandomization was stratified by metastatic status at initial diagnosis, investigator\ndecision to use bevacizumab, and PD-L1 status (CPS <1 vs. CPS 1 to <10 vs. CPS \u226510).\nPatients were randomized (1:1) to one of the two treatment groups:\nTreatment Group 1: KEYTRUDA 200 mg plus chemotherapy with or without\nbevacizumab\nTreatment Group 2: Placebo plus chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab\nThe investigator selected one of the following four treatment regimens prior to\nrandomization:\n1. Paclitaxel 175 mg/m  + cisplatin 50 mg/m\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2. Paclitaxel 175 mg/m  + cisplatin 50 mg/m  + bevacizumab 15 mg/kg\n3. Paclitaxel 175 mg/m  + carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min\n4. Paclitaxel 175 mg/m  + carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min + bevacizumab 15 mg/kg\nAll study medications were administered as an intravenous infusion. All study treatments\nwere administered on Day 1 of each 3-week treatment cycle. Cisplatin could be\nadministered on Day 2 of each 3-week treatment cycle. Treatment with KEYTRUDA\ncontinued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or a\nmaximum of 24 months. Administration of KEYTRUDA was permitted beyond RECIST-\ndefined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered to be\nderiving clinical benefit by the investigator. Assessment of tumor status was performed\nevery 9 weeks for the first year, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. The main\nefficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by investigator according to\nRECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5\ntarget lesions per organ. Additional efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR,\naccording to RECIST v1.1, as assessed by investigator.\nOf the 617 enrolled patients, 548 patients (89%) had tumors expressing PD-L1 with a\nCPS \u22651. Among these 548 enrolled patients with tumors expressing PD-L1, 273 patients\nwere randomized to KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy with or without\nbevacizumab, and 275 patients were randomized to placebo in combination with\nchemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. Sixty-three percent of the 548 patients\nreceived bevacizumab as part of study treatment. The baseline characteristics of the\n548 patients were: median age of 51 years (range: 22 to 82), 16% age 65 or older; 59%\nWhite, 18% Asian, 6% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 1% Black; 37% Hispanic or\nLatino; 56% ECOG performance status 0 and 43% ECOG performance status 1.\nSeventy-five percent had squamous cell carcinoma, 21% adenocarcinoma, and 5%\nadenosquamous histology, and 32% of patients had metastatic disease at diagnosis. At\nstudy entry, 21% of patients had metastatic disease only and 79% had persistent or\nrecurrent disease with or without distant metastases, of whom 39% had received prior\nchemoradiation only and 17% had received prior chemoradiation plus surgery.\nA statistically significant improvement in OS and PFS was demonstrated in patients\nrandomized to receive KEYTRUDA compared with patients randomized to receive\nplacebo. An updated OS analysis was conducted at the time of final analysis when 354\ndeaths in the CPS \u22651 population were observed.

The trial excluded patients\nwith autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression.\nPatients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable\ntoxicity or documented disease progression. Patients with initial radiographic disease\nprogression could receive additional doses of treatment during confirmation of\nprogression unless disease progression was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive,\nrequired urgent intervention, or occurred with a decline in performance status. Patients\nwithout disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. Assessment of\ntumor status was performed every 9 weeks for the first 12 months, and every 12\nweeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR according to RECIST\nv1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target\nlesions per organ, as assessed by BICR, and DoR.\nAmong the 98 patients in Cohort E, 77 (79%) had tumors that expressed PD-L1 with a\nCPS \u2265 1 and received at least one line of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. PD-L1\nTreatment arms include KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, versus\nplacebo plus chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab.\nBased on the protocol-specified final OS analysis\nstatus was determined using the IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit. The baseline characteristics of\nthese 77 patients were: median age of 45 years (range: 27 to 75); 81% White, 14%\nAsian, and 3% Black; 32% ECOG PS of 0 and 68% ECOG PS of 1; 92% had squamous\ncell carcinoma, 6% adenocarcinoma, and 1% adenosquamous histology; 95% had M1\ndisease and 5% had recurrent disease; and 35% had one and 65% had two or more\nprior lines of therapy in the recurrent or metastatic setting.\nNo responses were observed in patients whose tumors did not have PD-L1 expression\n(CPS <1).

Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg\nintravenously every 3 weeks or placebo.\nTreatment with KEYTRUDA continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease\nas determined by BICR, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months.\nAssessment of tumor status was performed every 6 weeks. The main efficacy outcome\nmeasure was OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS, ORR, and DoR, as\nassessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions\nand a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ.\nThe study enrolled 453 patients, and 360 (79%) had active hepatitis B.

The study design included two separate cohorts based on MMR\nstatus; 222 (27%) patients were in dMMR cohort, 588 (73%) patients were in pMMR\ncohort. The trial enrolled measurable Stage III, measurable Stage IVA, Stage IVB or\nrecurrent endometrial cancer (with or without measurable disease). Patients who had\nnot received prior systemic therapy or had received prior chemotherapy in the adjuvant\nsetting were eligible. Patients who had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy were only\neligible if their chemotherapy-free interval was at least 12 months. Patients with\nendometrial sarcoma, including carcinosarcoma, or patients with active autoimmune\ndisease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible.\nRandomization was stratified according to MMR status, ECOG PS (0 or 1 vs. 2), and\nprior adjuvant chemotherapy.\nPatients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms:\nKEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks, paclitaxel 175 mg/m  and carboplatin AUC 5\nmg/mL/min for 6 cycles, followed by KEYTRUDA 400 mg every 6 weeks for up to 14\ncycles.\nPlacebo every 3 weeks, paclitaxel 175 mg/m  and carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min for 6\ncycles, followed by placebo every 6 weeks for up to 14 cycles.\nAll study medications were administered as an intravenous infusion on Day 1 of each\ntreatment cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,\nor a maximum of 20 cycles (up to approximately 24 months). Patients with measurable\ndisease who had RECIST-defined stable disease or partial response at the completion of\ncycle 6 were permitted to continue receiving paclitaxel and carboplatin with KEYTRUDA\nor placebo for up to 10 cycles as determined by the investigator. Assessment of tumor\nstatus was performed every 9 weeks for the first 9 months and then every 12 weeks\nthereafter.

Patients with endometrial sarcoma,\nincluding carcinosarcoma, or patients who had active autoimmune disease or a medical\ncondition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Patients with endometrial\ncarcinoma that were pMMR (using the VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel test) or not MSI-H\nwere stratified by ECOG performance status, geographic region, and history of pelvic\nradiation. Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms:\nKEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks in combination with lenvatinib 20 mg\norally once daily.\nInvestigator\u2019s choice, consisting of either doxorubicin 60 mg/m  every 3 weeks or\npaclitaxel 80 mg/m  given weekly, 3 weeks on/1 week off.\nTreatment with KEYTRUDA and lenvatinib continued until RECIST v1.1-defined\n2\n2\nTreatment with KEYTRUDA and lenvatinib continued until RECIST v1.1-defined\nprogression of disease as verified by BICR, unacceptable toxicity, or for KEYTRUDA, a\nmaximum of 24 months. Treatment was permitted beyond RECIST v1.1-defined disease\nprogression if the treating investigator considered the patient to be deriving clinical\nbenefit, and the treatment was tolerated. Assessment of tumor status was performed\nevery 8 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by\nBICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a\nmaximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Additional efficacy outcome measures included\nORR and DoR, as assessed by BICR.\nAmong the 697 pMMR patients, 346 patients were randomized to KEYTRUDA in\ncombination with lenvatinib, and 351 patients were randomized to investigator\u2019s choice\nof doxorubicin (n=254) or paclitaxel (n=97). The pMMR population characteristics were:\nmedian age of 65 years (range: 30 to 86), 52% age 65 or older; 62% White, 22% Asian,\nand 3% Black; 60% ECOG PS of 0 and 40% ECOG PS of 1. The histologic subtypes were\nendometrioid carcinoma (55%), serous (30%), clear cell carcinoma (7%), mixed (4%),\nand other (3%). All 697 of these patients received prior systemic therapy for endometrial\ncarcinoma: 67% had one, 30% had two, and 3% had three or more prior systemic\ntherapies.

The trial enrolled 90 patients\nwith unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or dMMR endometrial carcinoma in Cohorts D and\nK who received at least one dose of KEYTRUDA. MSI or MMR tumor status was\ndetermined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or immunohistochemistry (IHC),\nrespectively. Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required\nimmunosuppression were ineligible. Patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously\nevery 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or documented disease progression. Patients\ntreated with KEYTRUDA without disease progression could be treated for up to 24\nmonths. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks for the first 12\nmonths, and every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were\nORR and DoR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a\nmaximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ.\nAmong the 90 patients evaluated, the baseline characteristics were: median age of 64\nyears (range: 42 to 86); 83% White, 8% Asian, and 3% Black; 12% Hispanic or Latino;\n39% ECOG PS of 0 and 61% ECOG PS of 1; 96% had M1 disease and 4% had M0\ndisease at study entry; and 51% had one and 48% had two or more prior lines of\ntherapy. Nine patients received only adjuvant therapy and one patient received only\nneoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy before participating in the study.\nEfficacy results are summarized in Table 98.\nTable 98: Efficacy Results in Patients with\nAdvanced MSI-H or dMMR Endometrial\nCarcinoma in KEYNOTE-158\nEndpoint\nKEYTRUDA\nn=90\n+ Denotes ongoing response\nNR = not reached\n*\nObjective Response\nRate\n  ORR (95% CI)\n46% (35, 56)\n    Complete response\nrate\n12%\n    Partial response rate\n33%\nDuration of Response\nn=41\n  Median in months\n(range)\nNR (2.9, 55.7+)\n  % with duration \u226512\nmonths\n68%\n  % with duration \u226524\nmonths\n44%\n14.17 Tumor Mutational Burden-High Cancer\nThe efficacy of KEYTRUDA was investigated in a prospectively-planned retrospective\nanalysis of 10 cohorts (A through J) of patients with various previously treated\nunresectable or metastatic solid tumors with high tumor mutation burden (TMB-H) who\nwere enrolled in a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label trial, KEYNOTE-158\n(NCT02628067). The trial excluded patients who previously received an anti-PD-1 or\nother immune-modulating monoclonal antibody, or who had an autoimmune disease, or\na medical condition that required immunosuppression. Patients received KEYTRUDA 200\nmg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or documented disease\nprogression. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks for the first 12\nmonths and every 12 weeks thereafter.\nThe statistical analysis plan pre-specified \u226510 and \u226513 mutations per megabase using\nthe FoundationOne CDx assay as cutpoints to assess TMB. Testing of TMB was blinded\nwith respect to clinical outcomes. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and\nDoR in patients who received at least one dose of KEYTRUDA as assessed by BICR\naccording to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a\nmaximum of 5 target lesions per organ.\nIn KEYNOTE-158, 1050 patients were included in the efficacy analysis population. TMB\nwas analyzed in the subset of 790 patients with sufficient tissue for testing based on\nprotocol-specified testing requirements. Of the 790 patients, 102 (13%) had tumors\nidentified as TMB-H, defined as TMB \u226510 mutations per megabase. Among the 102\npatients with TMB-H advanced solid tumors, the study population characteristics were:\nmedian age of 61 years (range: 27 to 80), 34% age 65 or older; 34% male; 81% White;\nand 41% ECOG PS of 0 and 58% ECOG PS of 1.

The trial excluded patients with\nautoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression.\nPatients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until documented\ndisease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Patients with\ninitial radiographic disease progression could receive additional doses of KEYTRUDA\nduring confirmation of progression unless disease progression was symptomatic,\nrapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, or occurred with a decline in\nperformance status.\nAssessment of tumor status was performed every 6 weeks during the first year, and\nevery 9 weeks during the second year. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR\nand DoR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum\nof 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ.\nAmong the 105 patients with recurrent or metastatic cSCC treated, the study population\ncharacteristics were: median age of 72 years (range: 29 to 95), 71% age 65 or older;\n76% male; 71% White, 25% race unknown; 34% ECOG PS of 0 and 66% ECOG PS of 1.\nForty-five percent of patients had locally recurrent only cSCC, 24% had metastatic only\ncSCC, and 31% had both locally recurrent and metastatic cSCC. Eighty-seven percent\nreceived one or more prior lines of therapy; 74% received prior radiation therapy.\nAmong the 54 patients with locally advanced cSCC treated, the study population\ncharacteristics were: median age of 76 years (range: 35 to 95), 80% age 65 or older;\n72% male; 83% White, 13% race unknown; 41% ECOG PS of 0 and 59% ECOG PS of 1.\nTwenty-two percent received one or more prior lines of therapy; 63% received prior\nradiation therapy.\nEfficacy results are summarized in Table 101.\nTable 101: Efficacy Results in KEYNOTE-629\nEndpoint\nKEYTRUDA\nRecurrent or\nMetastatic\ncSCC\nn=105\nKEYTRUDA\nLocally\nAdvanced\ncSCC\nn=54\nObjective Response\nNo TMB-H patients were identified in the cholangiocarcinoma cohort\n+ Denotes ongoing response\n*\nRate\n  ORR (95% CI)\n35% (26, 45)\n50% (36, 64)\n    Complete response\nrate\n11%\n17%\n    Partial response\nrate\n25%\n33%\nDuration of\nResponse\nn=37\nn=27\n    Median in months\n(range)\nNR (2.7, 30.4+)\nNR (1.0+,\n17.2+)\n    % with duration \u22656\nmonths\n76%\n81%\n    % with duration\n\u226512 months\n68%\n37%\n14.19 Triple-Negative Breast Cancer\nNeoadjuvant and Adjuvant Treatment of High-Risk Early-Stage TNBC\nThe efficacy of KEYTRUDA in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by\nsurgery and continued adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA as a single agent was\ninvestigated in KEYNOTE-522 (NCT03036488), a randomized (2:1), multicenter, double-\nblind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 1174 patients with newly diagnosed\npreviously untreated high-risk early-stage TNBC (tumor size >1 cm but \u22642 cm in\ndiameter with nodal involvement or tumor size >2 cm in diameter regardless of nodal\ninvolvement). Patients were enrolled regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression. Patients\nwith active autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within two years of\ntreatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible.\nRandomization was stratified by nodal status (positive vs. negative), tumor size (T1/T2\nvs. T3/T4), and choice of carboplatin (dosed every 3 weeks vs. weekly).\nPatients were randomized (2:1) to one of the following two treatment arms; all study\nmedications were administered intravenously:\nArm 1:\nFour cycles of preoperative KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles\n1-4 of treatment regimen in combination with:\nCarboplatin\nAUC 5 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles 1-4 of treatment\nregimen\n-or-\nAUC 1.5 mg/mL/min every week on Days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-4 of\ntreatment regimen\n-and-\nPaclitaxel 80 mg/m  every week on Days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-4 of\ntreatment regimen\nFollowed by four additional cycles of preoperative KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3\nweeks on Day 1 of cycles 5-8 of treatment regimen in combination with:\nMedian follow-up time: recurrent or metastatic cSCC: 23.8\nmonths; locally advanced cSCC: 13.4 months\n*\n2\n2\n2\nDoxorubicin 60 mg/m  -or- epirubicin 90 mg/m  every 3 weeks on Day 1 of\ncycles 5-8 of treatment regimen -and-\nCyclophosphamide 600 mg/m  every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles 5-8 of\ntreatment regimen\nFollowing surgery, nine cycles of KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks were\nadministered.\nArm 2:\nFour cycles of preoperative placebo every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles 1-4 of\ntreatment regimen in combination with:\nCarboplatin\nAUC 5 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles 1-4 of treatment\nregimen\n-or-\nAUC 1.5 mg/mL/min every week on Days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-4 of\ntreatment regimen\n-and-\nPaclitaxel 80 mg/m  every week on Days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-4 of\ntreatment regimen\nFollowed by four cycles of preoperative placebo every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles\n5-8 of treatment regimen in combination with:\nDoxorubicin 60 mg/m  -or- epirubicin 90 mg/m  every 3 weeks on Day 1 of\ncycles 5-8 of treatment regimen -and-\nCyclophosphamide 600 mg/m  every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles 5-8 of\ntreatment regimen\nFollowing surgery, nine cycles of placebo every 3 weeks were administered.\nThe main efficacy outcomes were pCR rate and EFS. pCR was defined as absence of\ninvasive cancer in the breast and lymph nodes (ypT0/Tis ypN0) and was assessed by the\nblinded local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery. EFS was defined as the time\nfrom randomization to the first occurrence of any of the following events: progression\nof disease that precludes definitive surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary\nmalignancy, or death due to any cause. An additional efficacy outcome was overall\nsurvival (OS).\nThe study population characteristics were: median age of 49 years (range: 22 to 80),\n11% age 65 or older; 99.9% female; 64% White, 20% Asian, 4.5% Black, and 1.8%\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native; 87% ECOG PS of 0 and 13% ECOG PS of 1; 56% were\npre-menopausal status and 44% were post-menopausal status; 7% were primary Tumor\n1 (T1), 68% T2, 19% T3, and 7% T4; 49% were nodal involvement 0 (N0), 40% N1, 11%\nN2, and 0.2% N3; 75% of patients were overall Stage II and 25% were Stage III.\nTable 102 and Figure 36 summarize the efficacy results for KEYNOTE-522.

Across six clinical studies in 2137 patients with various\na\ncancers treated with CYRAMZA, the incidence of all Grade hemorrhage ranged from 13-\n55%. Grade 3-5 hemorrhage incidence ranged from 2-5% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nPatients with gastric cancer receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nwere excluded from enrollment in REGARD and RAINBOW; therefore, the risk of gastric\nhemorrhage in CYRAMZA-treated patients with gastric tumors receiving NSAIDs is\nunknown.\nPatients with NSCLC receiving therapeutic anticoagulation or with evidence of major\nairway invasion by cancer were excluded from REVEL. In addition, patients with NSCLC\nwith a recent history of gross hemoptysis, those receiving chronic therapy with NSAIDs\nor other anti-platelet therapy other than once daily aspirin, or with radiographic evidence\nof major blood vessel invasion or intratumor cavitation were excluded from REVEL and\nRELAY; therefore, the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage in these groups of patients is\nunknown.\nPermanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience severe (Grade 3 or 4)\nbleeding [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].\n5.2 Gastrointestinal Perforations\nCYRAMZA can increase the risk of gastrointestinal perforation, a potentially fatal event.\nAcross six clinical studies in 2137 patients with various cancers treated with CYRAMZA,\nthe incidence of all Grade and Grade 3-5 gastrointestinal perforations ranged from <1-\n2% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nPermanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience a gastrointestinal\nperforation [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].\n5.3 Impaired Wound Healing\nImpaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the VEGF or\nVEGFR pathway. CYRAMZA, a VEGFR2 antagonist, has the potential to adversely affect\nwound healing. CYRAMZA has not been studied in patients with serious or non-healing\nwounds.\nWithhold CYRAMZA for 28 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer CYRAMZA\nfor at least 2 weeks following a major surgical procedure and until adequate wound\nhealing. The safety of resumption of CYRAMZA after resolution of wound healing\ncomplications has not been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].\n5.4 Arterial Thromboembolic Events\nSerious, sometimes fatal, arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs), including myocardial\ninfarction, cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular accident, and cerebral ischemia, occurred\nacross clinical trials. Across six clinical studies in 2137 patients with various cancers\ntreated with CYRAMZA, the incidence of all Grade ATE was 1-3%. Grade 3-5 ATE\nincidence was <1-2% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nPermanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience an ATE [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.6)].\n5.5 Hypertension\nAn increased incidence of severe hypertension occurred in patients receiving CYRAMZA.\nAcross five clinical studies, excluding RELAY, in 1916 patients with various cancers\ntreated with CYRAMZA, the incidence of all Grade hypertension ranged from 11-26%.\nGrade 3-5 hypertension incidence ranged from 6-15% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In\n221 patients with NSCLC receiving CYRAMZA in combination with erlotinib in the RELAY\nstudy, the incidence of new or worsening hypertension was higher (45%), as was the\nincidence of Grade 3-5 hypertension (24%). Of the patients experiencing new or\nworsening hypertension in RELAY (N=100 CYRAMZA and erlotinib; N=27 placebo and\nerlotinib), 13% of those treated with CYRAMZA and erlotinib required initiation of 3 or\nmore antihypertensive medications compared to 4% of patients treated with placebo\nand erlotinib.\nControl hypertension prior to initiating treatment with CYRAMZA. Monitor blood pressure\nevery two weeks or more frequently as indicated during treatment. Withhold CYRAMZA\nfor severe hypertension until medically controlled. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA\nfor medically significant hypertension that cannot be controlled with antihypertensive\ntherapy or in patients with hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy [see\nDosage and Administration (2.6)].\n5.6 Infusion-Related Reactions\nInfusion-related reactions (IRR), including severe and life-threatening IRR, occurred in\nCYRAMZA clinical trials. The majority of IRR across trials occurred during or following a\nfirst or second CYRAMZA infusion. Symptoms of IRR included rigors/tremors, back\npain/spasms, chest pain and/or tightness, chills, flushing, dyspnea, wheezing, hypoxia,\nand paresthesia. In severe cases, symptoms included bronchospasm, supraventricular\ntachycardia, and hypotension. Across six clinical studies in 2137 patients with various\ncancers treated with CYRAMZA in which premedication was recommended or required,\nthe incidence of all Grade IRR ranged from <1-9%. Grade 3-5 IRR incidence was <1%\n[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nPremedicate prior to each CYRAMZA infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].\nMonitor patients during the infusion for signs and symptoms of IRR in a setting with\navailable resuscitation equipment. Reduce the infusion rate by 50% for Grade 1-2 IRR.\nPermanently discontinue CYRAMZA for Grade 3-4 IRR [see Dosage and Administration\n(2.6)].\n5.7 Worsening of Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment\nClinical deterioration, manifested by new onset or worsening encephalopathy, ascites, or\nhepatorenal syndrome, was reported in patients with Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis who\nreceived single agent CYRAMZA. Use CYRAMZA in patients with Child-Pugh B or C\ncirrhosis only if the potential benefits of treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of\nclinical deterioration.\nBased on safety data from REACH-2, in patients with Child-Pugh A liver cirrhosis, the\npooled incidence of hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome was higher for\npatients who received CYRAMZA (6%) compared to patients who received placebo (0%)\n[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n5.8 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome\nPosterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) (also known as Reversible\nPosterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome [RPLS]) has been reported in <0.1% of 2137\npatients enrolled in six clinical studies with CYRAMZA. Symptoms of PRES include\nseizure, headache, nausea/vomiting, blindness, or altered consciousness, with or\nwithout associated hypertension.\nConfirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging and permanently\ndiscontinue CYRAMZA in patients who develop PRES. Symptoms may resolve or improve\nwithin days, although some patients with PRES can experience ongoing neurologic\nsequelae or death [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].\n5.9 Proteinuria Including Nephrotic Syndrome\nAcross six clinical studies in 2137 patients with various cancers treated with CYRAMZA,\nthe incidence of all Grade proteinuria ranged from 3-34%. Grade \u22653 proteinuria\n(including 4 patients with nephrotic syndrome) incidence ranged from <1-3% [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)].\nMonitor proteinuria by urine dipstick and/or urinary protein creatinine ratio. If the result\nof the urine dipstick is 2+ or greater, perform a 24-hour urine collection for protein\nmeasurement. Withhold CYRAMZA for urine protein levels that are 2 or more grams\nover 24 hours. Reinitiate CYRAMZA at a reduced dose once the urine protein level\nreturns to less than 2 grams over 24 hours. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA for\nurine protein levels greater than 3 grams over 24 hours or in the setting of nephrotic\nsyndrome [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].\n5.10 Thyroid Dysfunction\nAcross six clinical studies in 2137 patients with various cancers treated with CYRAMZA,\nthe incidence of Grade 1-2 hypothyroidism ranged from <1-3%; there were no reports\nof Grade 3-5 hypothyroidism [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor thyroid function\nduring treatment with CYRAMZA.\n5.11 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on its mechanism of action, CYRAMZA can cause fetal harm when administered\nto pregnant women. Animal models link angiogenesis, VEGF and VEGFR2 to critical\naspects of female reproduction, embryo-fetal development, and postnatal development.\nAdvise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive\npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with CYRAMZA and for 3\nmonths after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:\nHemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\nGastrointestinal Perforations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].\nImpaired Wound Healing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].\nArterial Thromboembolic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].\nHypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].\nInfusion-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].\nWorsening of Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].\nPosterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].\nProteinuria Including Nephrotic Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].\nProteinuria Including Nephrotic Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].\nThyroid Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe data described in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to\nCYRAMZA in 2137 patients from six studies: REGARD, RAINBOW, RAISE, REVEL,\nREACH-2, and RELAY.\nGastric Cancer\nThe safety of CYRAMZA was evaluated in REGARD and RAINBOW [see Clinical Studies\n(14.1)]. Patients in both trials had locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer\n(including GEJ adenocarcinoma) and had previously received platinum- or\nfluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy. Patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology\nGroup (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1. Both trials excluded patients with\nuncontrolled hypertension, major surgery within 28 days, or patients receiving chronic\nanti-platelet therapy other than once daily aspirin. REGARD excluded patients with\nbilirubin \u22651.5 mg/dL and RAINBOW excluded patients with bilirubin >1.5 times the upper\nlimit of normal (ULN).\nCYRAMZA Administered as a Single Agent (REGARD)\nPatients received either CYRAMZA 8 mg/kg or placebo intravenously every two weeks.\nPatients randomized to CYRAMZA received a median of 4 doses; the median duration of\nexposure was 8 weeks and 32 (14% of 236) patients received CYRAMZA for at least six\nmonths.\nThe most common serious adverse reactions with CYRAMZA were anemia (3.8%) and\nintestinal obstruction (2.1%). Red blood cell transfusions were given to 11% of\nCYRAMZA-treated patients versus 8.7% of patients who received placebo.\nThe most common adverse reactions (all grades) observed in CYRAMZA-treated patients\nat a rate of \u226510% and \u22652% higher than placebo were hypertension and diarrhea. Table\n2 provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions (CTCAE, version 4.0) in\nREGARD.\nTable 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u22655% of Patients with a \u22652%\nDifference Between Arms in REGARD\nAdverse Reactions\nCYRAMZA \n(N=236)\nPlacebo \n(N=115)\nAll Grades \n(%)\nGrade 3-4 \n(%)\nAll Grades \n(%)\nGrade 3-4 \n(%)\nVascular\n     Hypertension\n16\n8\n8\n3\nGastrointestinal\n     Diarrhea\n14\n1\n9\n2\nNervous System\n     Headache\n9\n0\n3\n0\na\n Hypertension is a consolidated term.\nMetabolism and Nutrition\n     Hyponatremia\n6\n3\n2\n1\nClinically relevant adverse reactions reported in \u22651% and <5% of CYRAMZA-treated\npatients in REGARD were:\nNeutropenia (4.7%)\nEpistaxis (4.7%)\nRash (4.2%)\nIntestinal obstruction (2.1%)\nArterial thromboembolic events (1.7%)\nAcross clinical trials of CYRAMZA administered as a single agent, clinically relevant\nadverse reactions (including Grade \u22653) reported in CYRAMZA-treated patients included\nproteinuria, gastrointestinal perforation, and IRR. In REGARD, according to laboratory\nassessment, 8% of CYRAMZA-treated patients developed proteinuria versus 3% of\nplacebo-treated patients. Two patients discontinued CYRAMZA due to proteinuria. The\nrate of gastrointestinal perforation in REGARD was 0.8% and the rate of IRR was 0.4%.\nCYRAMZA Administered in Combination with Paclitaxel (RAINBOW)\nPatients received paclitaxel 80 mg/m  on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle with\neither CYRAMZA 8 mg/kg or placebo intravenously every two weeks. Patients\nrandomized to CYRAMZA received a median of 9 doses; the median duration of\nexposure was 18 weeks, and 93 (28% of 327) patients received CYRAMZA for at least\nsix months.\nThe most common serious adverse reactions in patients who received CYRAMZA with\npaclitaxel were neutropenia (3.7%) and febrile neutropenia (2.4%); 19% of patients who\nreceived CYRAMZA with paclitaxel received granulocyte colony-stimulating factors.\nAdverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of any component of the CYRAMZA with\npaclitaxel combination in \u22652% of patients in RAINBOW were neutropenia (4%) and\nthrombocytopenia (3%).\nThe most common adverse reactions (all grades) observed in patients who received\nCYRAMZA with paclitaxel at a rate of \u226530% and \u22652% higher than placebo with paclitaxel\nwere fatigue/asthenia, neutropenia, diarrhea, and epistaxis.

Patients had\npreviously untreated EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutation-\npositive metastatic NSCLC. Patients had ECOG PS 0 or 1. RELAY excluded patients with\nbilirubin greater than the ULN, central nervous system (CNS) metastases, clinically active\ninterstitial lung disease (ILD), uncontrolled hypertension, major surgery within 28 days,\nradiographic evidence of major blood vessel invasion or encasement by cancer or intra-\ntumor cavitation, or gross hemoptysis within the preceding 2 months. The study also\nexcluded patients receiving chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) or\nanti-platelet therapy other than once daily aspirin.\nPatients received either CYRAMZA 10 mg/kg or placebo intravenously every two weeks\nin combination with erlotinib 150 mg taken orally once daily. Patients randomized to\nCYRAMZA received a median of 21 doses; the median duration of exposure was 11\nmonths, and 90 (41% of 221) patients received CYRAMZA for at least 12 months.\nThe most common serious adverse reactions in patients who received CYRAMZA with\nerlotinib were pneumonia (3.2%), cellulitis (1.8%), and pneumothorax (1.8%). Red blood\ncell transfusions were given to 3.2% of CYRAMZA-treated patients versus 0 patients\nwho received placebo.\nTreatment discontinuation of all study drugs due to adverse reactions occurred in 13%\nof CYRAMZA with erlotinib-treated patients, with increased alanine aminotransferase\n(1.4%) and paronychia (1.4%) being the most common. The most common adverse\na\nb\na\na,b\na\na\na\nreactions leading to treatment discontinuation of CYRAMZA were proteinuria (8.6%) and\nhyperbilirubinemia (6%).\nThe most common adverse reactions (all grades) observed in CYRAMZA with erlotinib-\ntreated patients at a rate of \u226530% of patients and \u22652% higher than placebo with\nerlotinib-treated patients were infections, hypertension, stomatitis, proteinuria, alopecia,\nand epistaxis.

Patients\nhad NSCLC with disease progression on or after one platinum-based therapy for locally\nadvanced or metastatic disease and ECOG PS 0 or 1. REVEL excluded patients with\nbilirubin greater than the ULN, uncontrolled hypertension, major surgery within 28 days,\nradiographic evidence of major airway or blood vessel invasion by cancer, radiographic\nevidence of intra-tumor cavitation, or gross hemoptysis within the preceding 2 months,\nand patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation or chronic anti-platelet therapy other\nthan once daily aspirin.\nPatients received either CYRAMZA 10 mg/kg or placebo intravenously in combination\nwith docetaxel 75 mg/m  intravenously every 21 days. Due to an increased incidence of\nneutropenia and febrile neutropenia in patients enrolled in East Asian sites, REVEL was\namended and 24 patients (11 patients receiving CYRAMZA with docetaxel, 13 patients\nreceiving placebo with docetaxel) at East Asian sites received a starting dose of\ndocetaxel at 60 mg/m  every three weeks. Patients randomized to CYRAMZA received a\nmedian of 4.5 doses; the median duration of exposure was 3.5 months, and 195 (31%\nof 627) patients received CYRAMZA for at least six months.\nThe most common serious adverse reactions in patients who received CYRAMZA with\ndocetaxel were febrile neutropenia (14%), pneumonia (6%), and neutropenia (5%). The\nuse of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors was 42% in CYRAMZA with docetaxel-\ntreated patients versus 37% in patients who received placebo with docetaxel.\nThe most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation of CYRAMZA\nwere IRR (0.5%) and epistaxis (0.3%). For patients with non-squamous histology, the\na\na\na\n2\n2\noverall incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage was 7% and the incidence of Grade \u22653\npulmonary hemorrhage was 1% for CYRAMZA with docetaxel compared to 6% overall\nincidence and 1% for Grade \u22653 pulmonary hemorrhage for placebo with docetaxel. For\npatients with squamous histology, the overall incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage was\n10% and the incidence of Grade \u22653 pulmonary hemorrhage was 2% for CYRAMZA with\ndocetaxel compared to 12% overall incidence and 2% for Grade \u22653 pulmonary\nhemorrhage for placebo with docetaxel. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse\nreactions occurred more frequently in CYRAMZA with docetaxel-treated patients (9%)\nthan in placebo with docetaxel-treated patients (5%).\nThe most common adverse reactions (all grades) observed in CYRAMZA with docetaxel-\ntreated patients at a rate of \u226530% and \u22652% higher than placebo with docetaxel were\nneutropenia, fatigue/asthenia, and stomatitis/mucosal inflammation.

The detection\nof antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.\nAdditionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody)\npositivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology,\nsample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying\ndisease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to CYRAMZA with the\nincidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading.\nIn clinical trials, 86/2890 (3%) of CYRAMZA-treated patients tested positive for\ntreatment-emergent anti-ramucirumab antibodies by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay (ELISA). Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 14 of the 86 patients who tested\npositive for treatment-emergent anti-ramucirumab antibodies.\n6.3 Postmarketing Experience\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of\nCYRAMZA. Because such reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of\nuncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a\ncausal relationship to drug exposure.\nBlood and lymphatic system: Thrombotic microangiopathy\nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: Hemangioma\nRespiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal: Dysphonia\nVascular: Arterial (including aortic) aneurysms, dissections, and rupture\nCardiac: Heart failure\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)], CYRAMZA can\ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data\non CYRAMZA use in pregnant women. Animal models link angiogenesis, VEGF and\na\nb\na\nVEGFR2 to critical aspects of female reproduction, embryo-fetal development, and\npostnatal development. No animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of\nramucirumab on reproduction and fetal development. Advise a pregnant woman of the\npotential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nNo animal studies have been specifically conducted to evaluate the effect of\nramucirumab on reproduction and fetal development. In mice, loss of the VEGFR2 gene\nresulted in embryo-fetal death and these fetuses lacked organized blood vessels and\nblood islands in the yolk sac. In other models, VEGFR2 signaling was associated with\ndevelopment and maintenance of endometrial and placental vascular function,\nsuccessful blastocyst implantation, maternal and feto-placental vascular differentiation,\nand development during early pregnancy in rodents and non-human primates.\nDisruption of VEGF signaling has also been associated with developmental anomalies\nincluding poor development of the cranial region, forelimbs, forebrain, heart, and blood\nvessels.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere is no information on the presence of ramucirumab in human milk or its effects on\nthe breastfed child or on milk production. Human IgG is present in human milk, but\npublished data suggest that breast milk antibodies do not enter the neonatal and infant\ncirculation in substantial amounts. Because of the potential risk for serious adverse\nreactions in breastfed children from ramucirumab, advise women not to breastfeed\nduring treatment with CYRAMZA and for 2 months after the last dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating\nCYRAMZA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nContraception\nBased on its mechanism of action, CYRAMZA can cause fetal harm when administered\nto a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nFemales\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment\nwith CYRAMZA and for 3 months after the last dose.\nInfertility\nFemales\nAdvise females of reproductive potential that based on animal data CYRAMZA may impair\nfertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of CYRAMZA in pediatric patients have not been\nestablished.\nThe safety and effectiveness of CYRAMZA as a single agent were assessed but not\nestablished in a single-arm, multicenter, open-label study [NCT02564198] that included\n23 pediatric patients aged 1 year to 16 years with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.\nThe effect on open tibial growth plates in pediatric patients who received CYRAMZA has\nnot been adequately studied; however, one patient in this study had progressive\nwidening of distal femoral growth plate. No other new safety signals were observed in\npediatric patients. The pharmacokinetics (PK) for these pediatric patients was within the\nrange of the values previously observed in adults given the same dose per body weight.\nJuvenile Animal Toxicity Data\nIn animal studies, effects on epiphyseal growth plates were identified. In cynomolgus\nmonkeys, anatomical pathology revealed adverse effects on the epiphyseal growth plate\n(thickening and osteochondropathy) at all doses tested (5-50 mg/kg). Ramucirumab\nexposure at the lowest weekly dose tested in the cynomolgus monkey was 0.2 times the\nexposure in humans at the recommended dose of ramucirumab as a single agent.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the 563 CYRAMZA-treated patients in REGARD and RAINBOW, 205 (36%) were 65\nand over, while 41 (7%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or\neffectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects.\nOf the 221 patients who received CYRAMZA with erlotinib in RELAY, 119 (54%) were 65\nand over, while 29 (13%) were 75 and over. Overall, no clinically meaningful differences\nin effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. Adverse\nreactions occurring at a 10% or higher incidence in patients receiving CYRAMZA with\nerlotinib and with a 10% or greater difference between patients aged 65 or older\ncompared to patients aged less than 65 years were: diarrhea (75% versus 65%),\nhypertension (50% versus 40%), increased ALT (49% versus 35%), increased AST (49%\nversus 33%), stomatitis (46% versus 36%), decreased appetite (32% versus 19%),\ndysgeusia (23% versus 12%), and weight loss (19% versus 6%).\nOf the 1253 patients in REVEL, 455 (36%) were 65 and over and 84 (7%) were 75 and\nover. Of the 627 patients who received CYRAMZA with docetaxel in REVEL, 237 (38%)\nwere 65 and over, while 45 (7%) were 75 and over. In an exploratory subgroup analysis\nof REVEL, the hazard ratio for overall survival in patients less than 65 years old was 0.74\n(95% CI: 0.62, 0.87) and in patients 65 years and over was 1.10 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.36).\nOf the 529 patients who received CYRAMZA with FOLFIRI in RAISE, 209 (40%) were 65\nand over, while 51 (10%) were 75 and over. Overall, no differences in safety or\neffectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects.\nOf the 197 patients who received CYRAMZA in REACH-2, 95 (48%) were 65 years and\nover, while 37 (19%) were 75 years and over. Overall, no differences in efficacy were\nobserved between these subjects and younger subjects.\n8.6 Hepatic Impairment\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild (total bilirubin within ULN and\naspartate aminotransferase [AST] >ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and any\nAST) or moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment.\nClinical deterioration was reported in patients with Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis who\nreceived single agent CYRAMZA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Clinical\nPharmacology (12.3)].\n11 DESCRIPTION\nRamucirumab is a human VEGFR2 antagonist. It is a recombinant human IgG1\nmonoclonal antibody. Ramucirumab has an approximate molecular weight of 147 kDa.\nRamucirumab is produced in genetically engineered mammalian NS0 cells.\nCYRAMZA (ramucirumab) injection for intravenous use is a sterile, preservative-free,\nclear to slightly opalescent and colorless to slightly yellow solution. CYRAMZA is supplied\nat a concentration of 10 mg/mL in either 100 mg (10 mL) or 500 mg (50 mL) single-dose\nvials. CYRAMZA is formulated in glycine (9.98 mg/mL), histidine (0.65 mg/mL), histidine\nmonohydrochloride (1.22 mg/mL), polysorbate 80 (0.1 mg/mL), sodium chloride\n(4.383 mg/mL), and Water for Injection, USP, pH 6.0.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nRamucirumab is a VEGFR2 antagonist that specifically binds VEGFR2 and blocks binding\nof VEGFR ligands, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D. As a result, ramucirumab inhibits\nligand-stimulated activation of VEGFR2, thereby inhibiting ligand-induced proliferation,\nand migration of human endothelial cells. Ramucirumab inhibited angiogenesis in an in\nvivo animal model.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics (PK) of ramucirumab were studied in patients with various\ncancers over a dose range of 6-12 mg/kg administered every two or three weeks. The\nPK characteristics of ramucirumab are similar for patients across cancer types based on\na population PK analysis. Ramucirumab systemic exposure increased dose\nproportionally at doses of 8 mg/kg and above and steady state concentrations were\nachieved at approximately 12 weeks.\nDistribution\nThe mean (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) volume of distribution of ramucirumab at\nsteady-state (Vss) was 5.4 L (15%).\nElimination\nThe mean (CV%) clearance of ramucirumab was 0.015 L/hour (30%) and the mean\nelimination half-life was 14 days (20%).\nSpecific Populations\nAge (19-88 years), sex (68% male), race (70% White, 24% Asian), renal impairment\n(creatinine clearance [CLcr] calculated by Cockcroft-Gault, 15-89 mL/min, mild hepatic\nimpairment (total bilirubin within ULN and AST>ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN\nand any AST), or moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 times ULN) had\nno clinically meaningful effect on the PK of ramucirumab. The effect of severe hepatic\nimpairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST) on the PK of ramucirumab is\nunknown.\nDrug Interaction Studies\nNo clinically meaningful changes in the exposure of either ramucirumab or its\nconcomitant drugs in the approved combinations, including paclitaxel, docetaxel,\nirinotecan (or its active metabolite, SN-38), and erlotinib were observed in patients with\nsolid tumors.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nNo animal studies have been performed to test ramucirumab for potential\ncarcinogenicity or genotoxicity.\nInhibition of VEGFR2 signaling in animal models was shown to result in changes to\nhormone levels critical for pregnancy, and, in monkeys, an increased duration of the\nfollicular cycle. In a 39 week animal study, female monkeys treated with ramucirumab\nshowed dose dependent increases in follicular mineralization of the ovary.\n13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nAdverse effects in the kidney (glomerulonephritis) occurred in monkeys at doses of 16-\n50 mg/kg (0.7-5.5 times the exposure in humans at the recommended dose of\nramucirumab as a single agent).\nA single dose of ramucirumab resulting in an exposure approximately 10 times the\nhuman exposure at the recommended dose of ramucirumab as a single agent did not\nsignificantly impair wound healing in monkeys using a full-thickness incisional model.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 Gastric Cancer\nREGARD\nThe efficacy of CYRAMZA was evaluated in REGARD (NCT00917384), a multinational,\nrandomized, double-blind, multicenter study in patients with locally advanced or\nmetastatic gastric cancer (including adenocarcinoma of the GEJ) who previously received\nplatinum- or fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy. Patients were required to have\nexperienced disease progression either within 4 months after the last dose of first-line\ntherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease or within 6 months after the last dose\nof adjuvant therapy. Patients were also required to have ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Patients\nwere randomized (2:1) to receive either an intravenous infusion of CYRAMZA 8 mg/kg or\nplacebo every 2 weeks. Randomization was stratified by weight loss over the prior 3\nmonths (\u226510% versus <10%), geographic region, and location of the primary tumor\n(gastric versus GEJ). The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). An\nadditional efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS).\nA total of 355 patients were randomized, 238 to the CYRAMZA-treatment group and 117\nto the placebo-treatment group. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were\nsimilar between treatment arms. The median age was 60 years (range 24-87); 70% were\nmen; 77% were White, 16% Asian; 28% had ECOG PS 0 and 72% had ECOG PS 1; 91%\nhad measurable disease; 75% had gastric cancer; and 25% had adenocarcinoma of the\nGEJ. The majority of patients (85%) experienced disease progression during or following\nfirst-line therapy for metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy for gastric cancer\nconsisted of platinum/fluoropyrimidine combination therapy (81%), fluoropyrimidine-\ncontaining regimens without platinum (15%), and platinum-containing regimens without\nfluoropyrimidine (4%). Patients received a median of 4 doses (range 1-34) of CYRAMZA\nor a median of 3 doses (range 1-30) of placebo.\nEfficacy results are shown in Table 10 and Figure 1.\nTable 10: Efficacy Results in REGARD\nAbbreviations: BSC = best supportive care; CI = confidence interval\n 65 of 199 events in CYRAMZA-treated patients and 31 of 108 events in placebo-treated patients\nwere deaths.\nCYRAMZA + BSC \nN=238\nPlacebo + BSC \nN=117\nOverall Survival\n     Number of deaths (%)\n179 (75%)\n99 (85%)\n     Median \u2013 months (95% CI)\n5.2 (4.4, 5.7)\n3.8 (2.8, 4.7)\n     Hazard Ratio (95% CI)\n0.78 (0.60, 0.998)\n     Stratified Log-rank p-value\n0.047\nProgression-free Survival\n     Number of events (%)\n199 (84%)\n108 (92%)\n     Median \u2013 months (95% CI)\n2.1 (1.5, 2.7)\n1.3 (1.3, 1.4)\n     Hazard Ratio (95% CI)\n0.48 (0.38, 0.62)\n     Stratified Log-rank p-value\n<0.001\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier Curves for Overall Survival in REGARD\na\na\nRAINBOW\nThe efficacy of CYRAMZA was evaluated in RAINBOW (NCT01170663), a multinational,\nrandomized, double-blind study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric\ncancer (including adenocarcinoma of the GEJ) who previously received platinum- and\nfluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy. Patients were required to have experienced\ndisease progression during, or within 4 months after the last dose of first-line therapy.\nPatients were also required to have ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Patients were randomized (1:1)\nto receive either CYRAMZA 8 mg/kg or placebo as an intravenous infusion every 2 weeks\n(on Days 1 and 15) of each 28-day cycle. Patients in both arms received paclitaxel\n80 mg/m  by intravenous infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Prior to\nadministration of each dose of paclitaxel, patients were required to have adequate\nhematopoietic and hepatic function. The paclitaxel dose was permanently reduced, in\nincrements of 10 mg/m , for a maximum of two dose reductions for Grade 4\nhematologic toxicity or Grade 3 paclitaxel-related non-hematologic toxicity.\nRandomization was stratified by geographic region, time to progression from the start\nof first-line therapy (<6 months versus \u22656 months), and disease measurability. The\nmajor efficacy outcome measure was OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures were\nPFS and overall response rate (ORR).\nA total of 665 patients were randomized, 330 to the CYRAMZA-treatment group and 335\nto the placebo-treatment group. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics\nwere similar between treatment arms. The median age was 61 years (range: 24-84);\n71% were men; 61% were White, 35% Asian; 39% had ECOG PS 0 and 61% had ECOG\nPS 1; 78% had measurable disease; 79% had gastric cancer; and 21% had\nadenocarcinoma of the GEJ.

Patients in RELAY were required to\nhave measurable disease, ECOG PS of 0 or 1, no central nervous system (CNS)\nmetastases, and no known EGFR T790M mutations at baseline. Patients were\nrandomized (1:1) to receive either CYRAMZA 10 mg/kg or placebo every 2 weeks as an\nintravenous infusion, in combination with erlotinib 150 mg orally once daily until disease\nprogression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by geographic region\n(East Asia versus other), gender, EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion versus exon 21\n[L858R] substitution mutation), and local EGFR testing method (therascreen\n and\ncobas  versus other polymerase chain reaction [PCR] and sequencing-based methods).\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was PFS as assessed by the investigator (RECIST\nv1.1). Additional efficacy outcome measures included OS, ORR, and duration of\nresponse (DoR).\nA total of 449 patients were randomized, 224 to the CYRAMZA-treatment group and 225\nto the placebo-treatment group. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics\nwere similar between treatment arms.

Patients in\nREVEL were also required to have ECOG PS 0 or 1. Patients were randomized (1:1) to\nreceive either CYRAMZA at 10 mg/kg or placebo by intravenous infusion, in combination\nwith docetaxel at 75 mg/m , every 21 days. Sites in East Asia administered a reduced\ndose of docetaxel at 60 mg/m  every 21 days. Patients who discontinued combination\ntherapy because of an adverse reaction attributed to either CYRAMZA/placebo or\ndocetaxel were permitted to continue monotherapy with the other treatment component\nuntil disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by\ngeographic region, sex, prior maintenance therapy, and ECOG PS. The major efficacy\noutcome measure was OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures included PFS and\nORR.\nA total of 1253 patients were randomized, 628 to the CYRAMZA-treatment group and\n625 to the placebo-treatment group.

Use an enteral tube that is 8 FR or higher to administer\ndosing volumes of 3 mL or higher. Instruct patients to divide dosing volumes of 3 mL or\nhigher into at least two aliquots and flush the tube after each administration. Flush the\ntube with a volume of water or milk that is equal to the aliquot administered. For a dose\ntube with a volume of water or milk that is equal to the aliquot administered. For a dose\nvolume of 30 mL, divide into at least three (10 mL) aliquots. The tube should be flushed\nwith water or milk after delivering each aliquot of ROZLYTREK.\nRefer to the Instructions for Use for detailed instructions on preparation and\nadministration of ROZLYTREK capsules as an oral suspension via an enteral tube.\nROZLYTREK Oral Pellets\nSprinkle pellets on one or more spoonfuls of a soft food (e.g., applesauce, yogurt, or\npudding) and take within 20 minutes of preparation. Do not crush or chew to avoid a\nbitter taste.\nThe patient should drink water after taking the pellets to ensure the drug has been\ncompletely swallowed.\nDo not attempt to use partial quantities of pellets from 50 mg pellet packets to prepare a\ndose.\nDo not use the pellet formulation for enteral tube administration as the pellets may clog\nthe tube.\nRefer to the Instructions for Use for detailed instructions on preparation and\nadministration of ROZLYTREK oral pellets.\n3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nCapsules:\n100 mg: Size 2 yellow opaque body and cap, with \"ENT 100\" printed in blue ink on\nbody.\n200 mg: Size 0 orange opaque body and cap, with \"ENT 200\" printed in blue ink on\nbody.\nPellets:\n50 mg: Supplied as brownish orange or grayish orange pellets in packets.\n4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nNone.\n5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n5.1 Congestive Heart Failure\nAmong the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, congestive heart\nfailure (CHF) occurred in 3.4% of patients, including Grade 3 (2.3%) [see Adverse\nReactions (6.1)]. In clinical trials, baseline cardiac function and routine cardiac monitoring\nother than electrocardiograms (ECGs) were not conducted and eligibility criteria\nexcluded patients with symptomatic CHF, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and\ncoronary artery bypass graft within 3 months of study entry. Among the 12 patients\nwith CHF, the median time to onset was 2 months (range: 11 days to 12 months).\nROZLYTREK was interrupted in 6 of these patients (50%) and discontinued in 2 of these\npatients (17%). CHF resolved in 6 patients (50%) following interruption or\ndiscontinuation of ROZLYTREK and institution of appropriate medical management. In\naddition, myocarditis in the absence of CHF was documented in 0.3% of patients.\nAssess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of ROZLYTREK. Monitor\npatients for clinical signs and symptoms of CHF, including shortness of breath and\nedema. For patients with myocarditis, with or without a decreased ejection fraction, MRI\nor cardiac biopsy may be required to make the diagnosis. For patients with new onset or\nworsening CHF, withhold ROZLYTREK, institute appropriate medical management, and\nreassess LVEF. Based on the severity of CHF or worsening LVEF, resume ROZLYTREK\nat a reduced dose upon recovery to baseline or permanently discontinue [see Dosage\nand Administration (2.7)].\n5.2 Central Nervous System Effects\nA broad spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions occurred in\npatients receiving ROZLYTREK, including cognitive impairment, mood disorders,\ndizziness, and sleep disturbances.\nAmong the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, 96 (27%)\nexperienced cognitive impairment; symptoms occurred within 3 months of starting\nROZLYTREK in 74 (77%). Cognitive impairment included cognitive disorders (8%),\nconfusional state (7%), disturbance in attention (4.8%), memory impairment (3.7%),\namnesia (2.5%), aphasia (2.3%), mental status changes (2%), hallucinations (1.1%), and\ndelirium (0.8%). Grade 3 cognitive adverse reactions occurred in 4.5% of patients.\nAmong the 96 patients with cognitive impairment, 13% required a dose reduction, 18%\nrequired dose interruption and 1% discontinued ROZLYTREK due to cognitive adverse\nreactions.\nAmong the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, 36 (10%)\nexperienced mood disorders. The median time to onset of mood disorders was 1 month\n(range: 1 day to 9 months). Mood disorders occurring in \u2265 1% of patients included\nanxiety (4.8%), depression (2.8%) and agitation (2%). Grade 3 mood disorders occurred\nin 0.6% of patients. One completed suicide was reported 11 days after treatment had\nended. Among the 36 patients who experienced mood disorders, 6% required a dose\nreduction, 6% required dose interruption and no patients discontinued ROZLYTREK due\nto mood disorders.\nDizziness occurred in 136 (38%) of the 355 patients. Among the 136 patients who\nexperienced dizziness, Grade 3 dizziness occurred in 2.2% of patients. Ten percent of\npatients required a dose reduction, 7% required dose interruption and 0.7%\ndiscontinued ROZLYTREK due to dizziness.\nAmong the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, 51 (14%)\nexperienced sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbances included insomnia (7%),\nsomnolence (7%), hypersomnia (1.1%), and sleep disorder (0.3%). Grade 3 sleep\ndisturbances occurred in 0.6% of patients. Among the 51 patients who experienced\nsleep disturbances, 6% required a dose reduction and no patients discontinued\nROZLYTREK due to sleep disturbances.\nThe incidence of CNS adverse reactions was similar in patients with and without CNS\nmetastases; however, the incidence of dizziness (38% vs 31%), headache (21% vs\n13%), paresthesia (20% vs 6%), balance disorder (13% vs 4%), and confusional state\n(11% vs 2%) appeared to be increased in patients with CNS metastases who had\nreceived prior CNS irradiation (n = 90) compared to those who did not (n = 48).\nAdvise patients and caregivers of these risks with ROZLYTREK. Advise patients not to\ndrive or operate hazardous machinery if they are experiencing CNS adverse reactions.\nWithhold and then resume at same or reduced dose upon improvement, or permanently\ndiscontinue ROZLYTREK based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].\n5.3 Skeletal Fractures\nROZLYTREK increases the risk of fractures. In an expanded safety population that\nincluded 338 adult patients and 76 pediatric patients who received ROZLYTREK across\nclinical trials, 5% of adult patients and 25% of pediatric patients experienced fractures\n[see Use in Specific Population (8.4)]. In adult and pediatric patients, some fractures\noccurred in the setting of a fall or other trauma to the affected area; in pediatric patients\nsome fractures occurred with no trauma. In general, there was inadequate assessment\nfor tumor involvement at the site of fracture; however, radiologic abnormalities possibly\nindicative of tumor involvement were reported in some adult patients. In both adult and\npediatric patients, most fractures were hip or other lower extremity fractures (e.g.,\nfemoral or tibial shaft). In two pediatric patients, bilateral femoral neck fractures\noccurred. A total of 41 fracture events were reported in 19 pediatric patients, with 13\npatients who experienced more than one occurrence of fracture. Among the 19\npediatric patients who experienced fractures, 17 patients were less than 12 years of\nage. Among the 41 fracture events, 27 fracture events resolved, 4 fracture events\nresolved with sequelae and 3 events were resolving. The median time to fracture was\n3.8 months (range 0.3 to 18.5 months) in adults and 4.3 months (range: 2 months to\n28.7 months) in pediatric patients. ROZLYTREK was interrupted in 41% of adults and\n16% of pediatric patients who experienced fractures. Five pediatric patients\ndiscontinued treatment due to fractures.\nPromptly evaluate patients with signs or symptoms (e.g., pain, changes in mobility,\ndeformity) of fractures. There are no data on the effects of ROZLYTREK on healing of\nknown fractures and risk of future fractures.\n5.4 Hepatotoxicity\nAmong the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK, increased AST of any grade\noccurred in 42% of patients and increased ALT of any grade occurred in 36%. Grade 3 \u2013\n4 increased AST or ALT occurred in 2.5% and 2.8% of patients, respectively; the\nincidence may be underestimated as 4.5% of patients had no post-treatment liver\nfunction tests [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The median time to onset of increased AST\nwas 2 weeks (range: 1 day to 29.5 months). The median time to onset of increased ALT\nwas 2 weeks (range: 1 day to 9.2 months). Increased AST or ALT leading to dose\ninterruptions or reductions occurred in 0.8% and 0.8% of patients, respectively.\nROZLYTREK was discontinued due to increased AST or ALT in 0.8% patients.\nMonitor liver tests, including ALT and AST, every 2 weeks during the first month of\ntreatment, then monthly thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently\ndiscontinue ROZLYTREK based on the severity. If withheld, resume ROZLYTREK at the\nsame or reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].\n5.5 Hyperuricemia\nAmong 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, 32 patients (9%)\nexperienced hyperuricemia reported as adverse reactions with symptoms, as well as\nelevated uric acid levels. Grade 4 hyperuricemia occurred in 1.7% of patients, including\none patient who died due to tumor lysis syndrome. Among the 32 patients with\nhyperuricemic adverse reactions, 34% required urate-lowering medication to reduce uric\nacid levels, 6% required dose reduction and 6% required dose interruption.\nHyperuricemia resolved in 73% of patients following initiation of urate-lowering\nmedication without interruption or dose reduction of ROZLYTREK. No patients\ndiscontinued ROZLYTREK due to hyperuricemia.\nAssess serum uric acid levels prior to initiation of ROZLYTREK and periodically during\ntreatment. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia. Initiate treatment\nwith urate-lowering medications as clinically indicated and withhold ROZLYTREK for signs\nand symptoms of hyperuricemia. Resume ROZLYTREK at same or reduced dose upon\nimprovement of signs or symptoms based on severity [see Dosage and Administration\n(2.7)].\n5.6 QT Interval Prolongation\nAmong the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across the clinical trials, 3.1% of\npatients with at least one post-baseline ECG assessment experienced QTcF interval\nprolongation of > 60 ms after starting ROZLYTREK and 0.6% had a QTcF interval > 500\nms [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].\nMonitor patients who already have or who are at significant risk of developing QTc\ninterval prolongation, including patients with known long QT syndromes, clinically\nsignificant bradyarrhythmias, severe or uncontrolled heart failure and those taking other\nmedicinal products associated with QT prolongation. Assess QT interval and electrolytes\nprior to initiation of ROZLYTREK and periodically during treatment, adjusting frequency\nbased upon risk factors such as congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or\nconcomitant medications known to prolong the QTc interval. Based on the severity of\nQTc interval prolongation, withhold ROZLYTREK and then resume at same or reduced\ndose, or permanently discontinue [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].\n5.7 Vision Disorders\nAmong the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, vision changes\noccurred in 21% of patients, including Grade 1 (17%), Grade 2 (2.8%) and Grade 3\n(0.8%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Vision disorders occurring in \u2265 1% included\nblurred vision (9%), photophobia (5%), diplopia (3.1%), visual impairment (2%),\nphotopsia (1.1%), cataract (1.1%), and vitreous floaters (1.1%).\nFor patients with new visual changes or changes that interfere with activities of daily\nliving, withhold ROZLYTREK until improvement or stabilization and conduct an\nophthalmological evaluation as clinically appropriate. Upon improvement or stabilization,\nresume ROZLYTREK at same or reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].\n5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on literature reports in humans with congenital mutations leading to changes in\nTRK signaling, findings from animal studies, and its mechanism of action, ROZLYTREK\ncan cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of\nentrectinib to pregnant rats resulted in malformations at exposures approximately 2.7\ntimes the human exposure at the 600 mg dose based on area under the curve (AUC).\nAdvise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of\nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ROZLYTREK\nand for 5 weeks following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of\nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ROZLYTREK\nand for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the\nlabeling:\nCongestive Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nCentral Nervous System Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nSkeletal Fractures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\nHepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]\nHyperuricemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]\nQT Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]\nVision Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]\n6.1 Clinical Trial Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nData in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and below reflect exposure to ROZLYTREK in\n355 patients, including 172 (48%) patients exposed for 6 months or longer and 84\n(24%) patients exposed for 1 year or longer. ROZLYTREK was studied in one dose-\nfinding trial in adults [ALKA (n = 57)], one dose-finding and activity-estimating trial in\nadults [STARTRK-1 (n = 76)], one dose-finding and activity-estimating trial in pediatric\nand adult patients [STARTRK-NG (n = 16)], and one single arm, activity-estimating trial in\nadults [STARTRK-2 (n = 206)].\nThe population characteristics were: median age 55 years (range: 4 to 86 years); 5% (n\n= 17) were less than 18 years of age; 55% were female; and 66% were White, 23%\nwere Asian, and 5% were Black; 3% were Hispanic/Latino. The most common tumors (\u2265\n5%) were lung (56%), sarcoma (8%), and colon (5%). ROS1 gene fusions were present\nin 42% and NTRK gene fusions were present in 20%. Most adults (75%) received\nROZLYTREK 600 mg orally once daily. The doses ranged from 100 mg/m  to 1600\nmg/m  once daily in adults and 250 mg/m  to 750 mg/m  once daily in pediatric patients.\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 39% of patients. The most frequent serious\nadverse reactions (\u2265 2%) were pneumonia (3.9%), dyspnea (3.7%), pleural effusion\n(3.4%), sepsis (2.5%), pulmonary embolism (2.3%), respiratory failure (2%), and pyrexia\n(2%). Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions occurred in 60% of patients; the most common (\u2265\n2%) were lung infection (5%), increased weight (7%), dyspnea (6%), fatigue/asthenia\n(5%), cognitive disorders (4.5%), syncope (2.5%), pulmonary embolism (3.4%), hypoxia\n(3.4%), pleural effusion (3.1%), hypotension (2.8%), diarrhea (2%), and urinary tract\ninfection (2.5%). Fatal events included dyspnea (0.6%), pneumonia (0.6%), sepsis\n(0.6%), completed suicide (0.3%), large intestine perforation (0.3%) and tumor lysis\nsyndrome (0.3%). One patient developed Grade 4 myocarditis after one dose of\nROZLYTREK which resolved after discontinuation of ROZLYTREK and administration of\n2\n2\n2\n2\nhigh-dose corticosteroids.\nPermanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 9% of patients who\nreceived ROZLYTREK. The most frequent adverse reactions (< 1% each) that resulted in\npermanent discontinuation were pneumonia, cardio-respiratory arrest, dyspnea, and\nfatigue.\nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 46% of patients. The most\nfrequent adverse reactions (\u2265 2%) that resulted in interruption were increased blood\ncreatinine (4%), fatigue (3.7%), anemia (3.1%), diarrhea (2.8%), pyrexia (2.8%),\ndizziness (2.5%), dyspnea (2.3%), nausea (2.3%), pneumonia (2.3%), cognitive disorder\n(2%) and neutropenia (2%).\nDose reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 29% of patients who received\nROZLYTREK.

Avoid coadministration of\nstrong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with ROZLYTREK. If coadministration is\nunavoidable, reduce the ROZLYTREK dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Clinical\nPharmacology (12.3)].\nPediatric Patients less than 2 Years\nAvoid coadministration of ROZLYTREK with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors [see\nClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nAvoid grapefruit products during treatment with ROZLYTREK, as they contain inhibitors\nof CYP3A.\nModerate and Strong CYP3A Inducers\nCoadministration of ROZLYTREK with a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer decreases\nentrectinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may reduce\nROZLYTREK efficacy. Avoid coadministration of strong and moderate CYP3A inducers\nwith ROZLYTREK.\n7.2 Drugs That Prolong QTc Interval\nQTc interval prolongation can occur with ROZLYTREK. Avoid coadministration of\nROZLYTREK with other products with a known potential to prolong QT/QTc interval [see\nWarnings and Precautions (5.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on literature reports in humans with congenital mutations leading to changes in\nTRK signaling, findings from animal studies, and its mechanism of action [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.1)], ROZLYTREK can cause fetal harm when administered to a\npregnant woman. There are no available data on ROZLYTREK use in pregnant women.\nAdministration of entrectinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis\nresulted in malformations at maternal exposures approximately 2.7 times the human\non NCI CTCAE v5.0\nexposure at the 600 mg dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to\na fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nHuman Data\nPublished reports of individuals with congenital mutations in TRK pathway proteins\nsuggest that decreases in TRK-mediated signaling are correlated with obesity,\ndevelopmental delays, cognitive impairment, insensitivity to pain, and anhidrosis.\nAnimal Data\nEntrectinib administration to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at a dose\nof 200 mg/kg [resulting in exposures up to 2.7 times the human exposure (AUC) at the\n600 mg dose] resulted in maternal toxicity and fetal malformations including body\nclosure defects (omphalocele and gastroschisis) and malformations of the vertebrae,\nribs, and limbs (micromelia and adactyly), but not embryolethality. Lower fetal weights\nand reduced skeletal ossification occurred at doses \u2265 12.5 and 50 mg/kg\n[approximately 0.2 and 0.9 times the human exposure (AUC) at the 600 mg dose],\nrespectively.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of entrectinib or its metabolites in human milk or their\neffects on either the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential\nserious adverse reactions in breastfed children from ROZLYTREK, advise a lactating\nwoman to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with ROZLYTREK and for 7 days\nafter the last dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating\nROZLYTREK [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nContraception\nROZLYTREK can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see\nUse in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nFemales\nAdvise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during\ntreatment with ROZLYTREK and for at least 5 weeks following the last dose [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.1)].\nMales\nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective\ncontraception during treatment with ROZLYTREK and for 3 months following the last\ndose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of ROZLYTREK have been established in pediatric patients\nolder than 1 month of age [Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Use of ROZLYTREK in these age\ngroups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of\nROZLYTREK in adults and pediatric patients with additional population pharmacokinetic\ndata demonstrating that the exposure of drug substance in pediatric patients greater\nthan 1 month of age is expected to be in the adult range, and that the course of disease\nis sufficiently similar in adult and pediatric patients to allow extrapolation of data in adults\nto pediatric patients.\nThe safety and effectiveness of ROZLYTREK have not been established in pediatric\npatients with ROS1-positive NSCLC.\nJuvenile Animal Toxicity Data\nIn a 13-week juvenile rat toxicology study, animals were dosed daily from post-natal day\n7 to day 97 (approximately equivalent to neonate to adulthood). Entrectinib resulted in:\ndecreased body weight gain and delayed sexual maturation at doses \u2265 4 mg/kg/day\n(approximately 0.06 times the human exposure (AUC) at the 600 mg dose),\ndeficits in neurobehavioral assessments including functional observational battery\nand learning and memory (at doses \u2265 8 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.14 times the\nhuman exposure at the 600 mg dose), and\ndecreased femur length at doses \u2265 16 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.18 times the\nhuman exposure at the 600 mg dose).\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, 25% were 65 years\nor older, and 5% were 75 years of age or older. Clinical studies of ROZLYTREK did not\ninclude sufficient numbers of geriatric patients to determine whether they respond\ndifferently from younger patients.\n8.6 Renal Impairment\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal\nimpairment (CLcr 30 to < 90 mL/min calculated by Cockcroft-Gault equation).\nROZLYTREK has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30\nmL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n8.7 Hepatic Impairment\nThe effect of moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 \u2013 3.0 times ULN with any\naspartate aminotransferase) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3.0 times ULN\nwith any aspartate aminotransferase) on the safety of ROZLYTREK at the recommended\ndosage is unknown. Consider the risk-benefit profile of ROZLYTREK prior to determining\nwhether to administer ROZLYTREK to patients with moderate to severe hepatic\nimpairment. Monitor for ROZLYTREK adverse reactions in patients with hepatic\nimpairment more frequently since these patients may be at increased risk for adverse\nreactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n11 DESCRIPTION\nEntrectinib is a kinase inhibitor. The molecular formula for entrectinib is C\nH\nF N O\nand the molecular weight is 560.64 Daltons. The chemical name is N-[5-(3,5-\ndifluorobenzyl)-1H-indazol-3-yl]-4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-\nylamino) benzamide. The chemical structure of entrectinib is as follows:\nEntrectinib is white to pale pink powder.\nCapsules:\nROZLYTREK (entrectinib) capsules for oral use are supplied as printed hard-shell\ncapsules containing 100 mg (yellow opaque HPMC capsule) or 200 mg of entrectinib\n(orange opaque HPMC capsule). Inactive ingredients are tartaric acid, lactose\nanhydrous, hypromellose, crospovidone, microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon\ndioxide, and magnesium stearate.\nThe yellow opaque capsule shell contains hypromellose, titanium dioxide, and yellow iron\noxide. The orange opaque capsule shell contains hypromellose, titanium dioxide, and\nFD&C yellow #6. The printing ink contains shellac, propylene glycol, strong ammonia\nsolution, and FD&C blue #2 aluminum lake.\nPellets:\nROZLYTREK (entrectinib) oral pellets are supplied as brownish orange or grayish orange,\nround film-coated pellets in packets. Each packet contains 50 mg of entrectinib and the\nfollowing inactive ingredients: tartaric acid, microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon\ndioxide, croscarmellose sodium, sodium stearyl fumarate, mannitol, and magnesium\nstearate.\nThe film-coating contains polyvinyl alcohol (partially hydrolyzed), titanium dioxide,\npolyethylene glycol 3350, talc, yellow iron oxide, red iron oxide, and ferrosoferric oxide.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nEntrectinib is an inhibitor of the tropomyosin receptor tyrosine kinases (TRK) TRKA,\nTRKB, and TRKC (encoded by the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase [NTRK] genes\nNTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3, respectively), proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase\nROS1 (ROS1), and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) with IC\n values of 0.1 to 2 nM.\nEntrectinib also inhibits JAK2 and TNK2 with IC\n values > 5 nM. The major active\nmetabolite of entrectinib, M5, showed similar in vitro activity against TRK, ROS1, and\n31\n34 2\n6\n2\n50\n50\nALK.\nFusion proteins that include TRK, ROS1, or ALK kinase domains can drive tumorigenic\npotential through hyperactivation of downstream signaling pathways leading to\nunconstrained cell proliferation. Entrectinib demonstrated in vitro and in vivo inhibition of\ncancer cell lines derived from multiple tumor types harboring NTRK, ROS1, and ALK\nfusion genes.\nEntrectinib demonstrated steady-state brain-to-plasma concentration ratios of 0.4 \u2013 2.2\nin multiple animal species (mice, rats, and dogs) and demonstrated in vivo anti-tumor\nactivity in mice with intracranial implantation of TRKA- and ALK-driven tumor cell lines.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nEntrectinib exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic\nresponses are unknown.\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nAcross clinical trials, 3.1% of 355 patients, who received ROZLYTREK at doses ranging\nfrom 100 mg to 2600 mg daily under fasting or fed conditions (75% received 600 mg\norally once daily) and had at least one post-baseline ECG assessment, experienced QTcF\ninterval prolongation of > 60 ms after starting ROZLYTREK and 0.6% had a QTc interval\n> 500 ms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics for entrectinib and its pharmacologically active major circulating\nmetabolite M5 were characterized in adult patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC, NTRK\ngene fusion-positive solid tumors, and healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of\nentrectinib and M5 are linear and are not dose-dependent or time-dependent. Steady\nstate is achieved within one week for entrectinib and two weeks for M5 following daily\nadministration of ROZLYTREK. The pharmacokinetic parameters for entrectinib and M5\nare described in Table 11.\nTable 11. Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Entrectinib and\nMetabolite M5\nParameter\nEntrectinib\nMean  (% CV)\nM5\nMean  (% CV)\n*\nAUC\n (nM*h)\n31800 (48%)\n10200 (82%)\nAUC\n (nM*h)\n48000 (77%)\n24000 (97%)\nC\n (nM)\n2250 (58%)\n622 (79%)\nC\n (nM)\n3130 (80%)\n1250 (90%)\nR\n1.55 (49%)\n2.84 (93%)\nAbsorption\nThe maximum entrectinib plasma concentration was reached 4 \u2013 6 hours after oral\nadministration of a 600 mg dose.\nEntrectinib exposure following a single oral dose (600 mg) of ROZLYTREK oral pellets\n*\n*\nGeometric mean\nD1\nss\nmaxD1\nmaxss\nacc(AUC)\nwas not clinically significant compared to ROZLYTREK capsule administered with a light\nmeal (250 calories: 25% fat) in healthy subjects. In STARTRK-2, STARTRK-NG and\nTAPISTRY studies, ROZLYTREK was administered without regard to food in patients.\nEntrectinib exposure of a single dose (600 mg) of ROZLYTREK capsules as a suspension\nwith water or milk, administered orally or through a nasogastric or gastric tube, was not\nclinically significant compared to administration of intact ROZLYTREK capsules in healthy\nsubjects under fasted conditions.\nEffect of Food\nA high-fat (approximately 50% of total caloric content), high-calorie (approximately 800\nto 1000 calories) meal did not have a significant effect on entrectinib exposure of\nROZLYTREK capsules.\nDistribution\nEntrectinib and its active major metabolite M5 are both > 99% bound to human plasma\nproteins in vitro.\nThe estimated apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was 551 L and 81.1 L for entrectinib\nand M5, respectively.\nElimination\nThe estimated apparent clearance (CL/F) was 19.6 L/h and 52.4 L/h for entrectinib and\nM5, respectively. The elimination half-lives of entrectinib and M5 were estimated to be 20\nand 40 hours, respectively.\nMetabolism\nEntrectinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 (~76%). The active metabolite M5\n(formed by CYP3A4) is the only major active circulating metabolite identified. M5 has\nsimilar pharmacological potency to entrectinib in vitro and circulating M5 exposures at\nsteady-state in patients were 40% of the corresponding entrectinib exposure.\nExcretion\nFollowing oral administration of a single oral dose of [\nC]-labeled entrectinib, 83% of\nradioactivity was excreted in feces (36% of the dose as unchanged entrectinib and 22%\nas M5) with minimal excretion in urine (3%).\nSpecific Populations\nNo clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib were observed\nbased on sex, race (White, Asian and Black), mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr\n30 to < 90 mL/min) and mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin \u2264 ULN with aspartate\naminotransferase > ULN or total bilirubin > 1.0 \u2013 1.5 times ULN with any aspartate\naminotransferase). The impact of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of\nentrectinib is unknown.\nHepatic Impairment\nFollowing administration of a single oral dose of ROZLYTREK 100 mg (1/6 of the\nrecommended dose), the entrectinib AUC\n was increased by 39% for the mild, 39% for\nthe moderate, and 23% for the severe hepatic impairment groups compared to the\nnormal hepatic function group. The combined AUC\n of entrectinib and M5 was\nincreased by 16% for the mild, 16% for the moderate, and 4% for the severe hepatic\n14\nINF\nlast\nimpairment groups compared to the normal hepatic function group. Large variability in\nsystemic exposure of entrectinib was observed in the hepatic impairment groups.\nPediatric Patients > 6 months\nIn pediatric patients older than 6 months administered 300 mg/m  (based on BSA) of\nROZLYTREK once daily, systemic exposure of the sum of entrectinib and M5 in pediatric\npatients receiving 300 mg/m  of ROZLYTREK once daily is within the range of the adults\ntreated with 600 mg of ROZLYTREK once daily.\nThe available efficacy and safety data also confirm the adequacy of the recommended\ndoses [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].\nPediatric Patients > 1 to \u2264 6 months\nIn pediatric patients > 1 to \u2264 6 months administered 250 mg/m  (based on BSA) of\nROZLYTREK once daily, systemic exposure of the sum of entrectinib and M5 in pediatric\npatients was at the lower range of the adults administered 600 mg of ROZLYTREK once\ndaily.\nThe available efficacy and safety data also confirm the adequacy of the recommended\ndoses [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].\nDrug Interaction Studies\nClinical Studies\nEffect of CYP3A Inhibitors on Entrectinib: Coadministration of itraconazole (a strong\nCYP3A inhibitor) with a single 100 mg dose of ROZLYTREK capsule increased entrectinib\nAUC\n by 6-fold and C\n by 1.7-fold [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Coadministration\nof a moderate CYP3A inhibitor with ROZLYTREK capsule is predicted to increase\nentrectinib AUC\n by 3-fold and C\n by 2.9-fold. Based on physiologically based\npharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling, a similar magnitude of the effect is expected in\nchildren as young as 2 years old.\nEffect of CYP3A Inducers on Entrectinib: Coadministration of rifampin (a strong CYP3A\ninducer) with a single 600 mg dose of ROZLYTREK capsule reduced entrectinib AUC\nby 77% and C\n by 56% [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Coadministration of a moderate\nCYP3A inducer with ROZLYTREK capsule is predicted to reduce entrectinib AUC\n by\n56% and C\n by 43%.\nEffect of Gastric Acid Reducing Drugs on Entrectinib: Coadministration of a proton pump\ninhibitor (PPI), lansoprazole with a single 600 mg dose of ROZLYTREK capsule reduced\nentrectinib AUC by 25% and C\n by 23%.\nCoadministration of lansoprazole, with a single 600 mg dose of ROZLYTREK capsule as\noral suspension in water increased entrectinib AUC by 25% and C\n by 17%. These\nchanges are not likely to be clinically significant.\nEffect of Entrectinib on CYP Substrates: Coadministration of 600 mg dose of\nROZLYTREK capsule once daily with oral midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) in\npatients increased the midazolam AUC by 50% but reduced midazolam C\n by 21%\n[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].\nEffect of Entrectinib on Transporters: Coadministration of a single 600 mg dose of\nROZLYTREK capsule with digoxin [a sensitive P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate] increased\ndigoxin C\n by 28% and AUC by 18%.\n2\n2\n2\n0-INF\nmax\n0-Tau\nmax\n0-INF\nmax\n0-Tau\nmax\nmax\nmax\nmax\nmax\nIn Vitro Studies\nEntrectinib is not a substrate of P-gp or BCRP, but M5 is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP.\nEntrectinib and M5 are not substrates of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies were not conducted with entrectinib. Entrectinib was not\nmutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay; however, an in vitro\nassay in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes did demonstrate a potential for\nabnormal chromosome segregation (aneugenicity). Entrectinib was not clastogenic or\naneugenic in the in vivo micronucleus assay in rats and did not induce DNA damage in a\ncomet assay in rats.\nDedicated fertility studies were not conducted with entrectinib. With the exception of\ndose-dependent decreases in prostate weight in male dogs, there were no effects on\nmale and female reproductive organs observed in general toxicology studies conducted\nin rats and dogs at doses resulting in exposures of up to approximately 3.2-fold the\nhuman exposure (AUC) at the 600 mg dose.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 ROS1-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\nThe efficacy of ROZLYTREK was evaluated in a pooled subgroup of patients with ROS1-\npositive metastatic NSCLC who received ROZLYTREK at various doses and schedules\n(90% received ROZLYTREK 600 mg orally once daily) and were enrolled in one of three\nmulticenter, single-arm, open-label clinical trials: ALKA, STARTRK-1 (NCT02097810) and\nSTARTRK-2 (NCT02568267). To be included in this pooled subgroup, patients were\nrequired to have histologically confirmed, recurrent or metastatic, ROS1-positive NSCLC,\nECOG performance status \u2264 2, measurable disease per RECIST v 1.1, \u2265 18 months of\nfollow-up from first post-treatment tumor assessment, and no prior therapy with a\nROS1 inhibitor. Identification of ROS1 gene fusion in tumor specimens was prospectively\ndetermined in local laboratories using either a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH),\nnext-generation sequencing (NGS), or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) laboratory-\ndeveloped tests. All patients were assessed for CNS lesions at baseline. The major\nefficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response\n(DOR) according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review\n(BICR). Intracranial response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors\n(RECIST v1.1) was assessed by BICR. Tumor assessments with imaging were performed\nevery 8 weeks.\nEfficacy was assessed in 92 patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC. The median age was 53\nyears (range: 27 to 86); female (65%); White (48%), Asian (45%), and Black (5%); and\nHispanic or Latino (2.4%); never smoked (59%); and ECOG performance status 0 or 1\n(88%). Ninety-nine percent of patients had metastatic disease, including 42% with CNS\nmetastases; 96% had adenocarcinoma; 65% received prior platinum-based\nchemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent disease and no patient had progressed in less\nmax\nthan 6 months following platinum-based adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. ROS1\npositivity was determined by NGS in 79%, FISH in 16%, and PCR in 4%. Twenty-five\npercent had central laboratory confirmation of ROS1 positivity using an analytically\nvalidated NGS test.\nEfficacy results are summarized in Table 12.\nTable 12.

To be included in this pooled subgroup, patients were\nrequired to have progressed following systemic therapy for their disease, if available, or\nwould have required surgery causing significant morbidity for locally advanced disease;\nmeasurable disease per RECIST v1.1; at least 2 years of follow-up from first post-\ntreatment tumor assessment; and no prior therapy with a TRK inhibitor. Patients\nreceived ROZLYTREK at various doses and schedules (94% received ROZLYTREK 600\nmg orally once daily) until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Identification of\npositive NTRK gene fusion status was prospectively determined in local laboratories or a\ncentral laboratory using various nucleic acid-based tests. The major efficacy outcome\nmeasures were ORR and DOR, as determined by a BICR according to RECIST v1.1.\nIntracranial response according to RECIST v1.1 as evaluated by BICR. Tumor\nassessments with imaging were performed every 8 weeks.\nObserved DOR\ndenotes ongoing response\n*\n\u2020\nEfficacy was assessed in the first 54 adult patients with solid tumors with an NTRK gene\nfusion enrolled into these trials. The median age was 58 years (range: 21 to 83); female\n(59%); White (80%), Asian (13%) and Hispanic or Latino (7%); and ECOG performance\nstatus 0 (43%) or 1 (46%). Ninety-six percent of patients had metastatic disease,\nincluding 22% with CNS metastases, and 4% had locally advanced, unresectable disease.\nAll patients had received prior treatment for their cancer including surgery (n = 43),\nradiotherapy (n = 36), or systemic therapy (n = 48). Forty patients (74%) received prior\nsystemic therapy for metastatic disease with a median of 1 prior systemic regimen and\n17% (n = 9) received 3 or more prior systemic regimens. The most common cancers\nwere sarcoma (24%), lung cancer (19%), salivary gland tumors (13%), breast cancer\n(11%), thyroid cancer (9%), and colorectal cancer (7%). A total of 52 (96%) patients had\nan NTRK gene fusion detected by NGS and 2 (4%) had an NTRK gene fusion detected by\nother nucleic acid-based tests. Eighty-three percent of patients had central laboratory\nconfirmation of NTRK gene fusion using an analytically validated NGS test.\nEfficacy results are summarized in Tables 13, 14, and 15.\nTable 13.

To\nbe included in the analysis, patients were required to have received at least 1 dose of\nROZLYTREK; measurable or evaluable disease at baseline; at least 6 months of follow-up;\nand no prior therapy with a TRK inhibitor. Patients received ROZLYTREK 20 mg to 600\nmg based on body surface area (BSA) orally or via enteral feeding tube once daily in 4-\nweek cycles until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The major efficacy\noutcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by BICR according to\nRECIST v1.1 for extracranial tumors and according to Response Assessment in Neuro-\nOncology (RANO) for primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors. An additional\nefficacy outcome measure was DOR as evaluated by BICR.\nEfficacy was assessed in 33 pediatric patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors\ntreated with ROZLYTREK. The median age was 4 years (range: 2 months to 15 years);\nmale (52%); White (58%), Asian (30%), other races (9%), Black or African American\n(3.0%), and Hispanic or Latino (9%). Seventy-one percent of patients had locally\nadvanced disease and 29% had metastatic disease. Eighty-five percent of patients had\nreceived prior treatment for their cancer including surgery (n=20), radiotherapy (n=7)\nand/or systemic therapy (n=22).

ROZLYTREK may cause congestive heart failure or make\nthe congestive heart failure that you already have worse. Your healthcare provider\nwill do tests before your treatment and may do tests during your treatment with\nROZLYTREK to check your heart function. Tell your healthcare provider right away if\nyou have any of the following signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure:\npersistent coughing or\nwheezing\ntrouble breathing when lying\ndown\nsudden weight gain\nincreasing shortness of\nbreath\ntiredness, weakness, or\nfatigue\nswelling in ankles, feet, or\nlegs\nCentral nervous system (CNS) effects. ROZLYTREK may cause dizziness,\nchanges in your mood, or may affect how you think and cause confusion,\nhallucinations, and problems with concentration, attention, memory, speaking,\nunderstanding what your hear or read, and sleep. Tell your healthcare provider right\naway if you have any of these symptoms.\nBone fractures. ROZLYTREK may increase your risk for bone fractures. Bone\nfractures may happen with or without a fall or other injury. Tell your healthcare\nprovider if you develop pain, changes in movement, or bone abnormalities.\nLiver problems (hepatotoxicity). Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to\ncheck your liver function during treatment with ROZLYTREK. Tell your healthcare\nprovider right away if you develop any of the following symptoms of liver problems:\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\nprovider right away if you develop any of the following symptoms of liver problems:\nloss of appetite\nnausea or vomiting\npain in your upper right\nstomach area\nyellowing of\nyour skin or\nthe white part\nof your eyes\ndark urine\nIncreased uric acid level in your blood (hyperuricemia). ROZLYTREK may\ncause too much uric acid in your blood. Your healthcare provider will do tests before\nand during your treatment with ROZLYTREK to check the uric acid level in your blood.\nYour healthcare provider may prescribe medications if you have high blood uric acid\nlevels. Tell your healthcare provider if you develop any of the following symptoms of\nhyperuricemia:\nred, hot, tender, or swollen joints, especially in\nyour big toe\npain in your stomach-area or sides\nnausea or vomiting\npink or brown urine\nChanges in the electrical activity of your heart called QT prolongation. QT\nprolongation can cause irregular heartbeats that can be life-threatening.

Among 357 patients who received LUMAKRAS in CodeBreaK 100 [see Adverse\nReactions (6.1)], hepatotoxicity occurred in 1.7% (all grades) and 1.4% (Grade 3). A total\nof 18% of patients who received LUMAKRAS had increased alanine aminotransferase\n(ALT)/increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST); 6% were Grade 3 and 0.6% were\nGrade 4. The median time to first onset of increased ALT/AST was 9 weeks (range: 0.3\nto 42). Increased ALT/AST leading to dose interruption or reduction occurred in 7% of\npatients. LUMAKRAS was discontinued due to increased ALT/AST in 2.0% of patients. In\nGrading defined by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology\nCriteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0\n2\naddition to dose interruption or reduction, 5% of patients received corticosteroids for\nthe treatment of hepatotoxicity.\nMonitor liver function tests (ALT, AST, and total bilirubin) prior to the start of LUMAKRAS,\nevery 3 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month or as clinically\nindicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase and/or\nbilirubin elevations. Withhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue LUMAKRAS based\non severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse\nReactions (6.1)].\n5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis\nLUMAKRAS can cause ILD/pneumonitis that can be fatal. Among 357 patients who\nreceived LUMAKRAS in CodeBreaK 100 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], ILD/pneumonitis\noccurred in 0.8% of patients, all cases were Grade 3 or 4 at onset, and 1 case was fatal.\nThe median time to first onset for ILD/pneumonitis was 2 weeks (range: 2 to 18 weeks).\nLUMAKRAS was discontinued due to ILD/pneumonitis in 0.6% of patients. Monitor\npatients for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g.,\ndyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold LUMAKRAS in patients with suspected\nILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue LUMAKRAS if no other potential causes of\nILD/pneumonitis are identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse\nReactions (6.1)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in\nother sections of the labeling:\nHepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nInterstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect\nexposure to LUMAKRAS as a single agent at 960 mg orally once daily in 357 patients\nwith NSCLC and other solid tumors with KRAS G12C mutation enrolled in CodeBreaK\n100, 28% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 3% were exposed for greater than\none year.\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer\nThe safety of LUMAKRAS was evaluated in a subset of patients with KRAS G12C-mutated\nlocally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in CodeBreaK 100 [see Clinical Studies (14)].\nPatients received LUMAKRAS 960 mg orally once daily until disease progression or\nunacceptable toxicity (n = 204). Among patients who received LUMAKRAS, 39% were\nexposed for 6 months or longer and 3% were exposed for greater than one year.\nThe median age of patients who received LUMAKRAS was 66 years (range: 37 to 86);\n55% female; 80% White, 15% Asian, and 3% Black.\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 50% of patients treated with LUMAKRAS. Serious\nadverse reactions in \u2265 2% of patients were pneumonia (8%), hepatotoxicity (3.4%), and\ndiarrhea (2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.4% of patients who received\nLUMAKRAS due to respiratory failure (0.8%), pneumonitis (0.4%), cardiac arrest (0.4%),\ncardiac failure (0.4%), gastric ulcer (0.4%), and pneumonia (0.4%).\nPermanent discontinuation of LUMAKRAS due to an adverse reaction occurred in 9% of\npatients. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of LUMAKRAS in \u2265\n2% of patients included hepatotoxicity (4.9%).\nDosage interruptions of LUMAKRAS due to an adverse reaction occurred in 34% of\npatients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in \u2265 2% of patients were\nhepatotoxicity (11%), diarrhea (8%), musculoskeletal pain (3.9%), nausea (2.9%), and\npneumonia (2.5%).\nDose reductions of LUMAKRAS due to an adverse reaction occurred in 5% of patients.\nAdverse reactions which required dose reductions in \u2265 2% of patients included\nincreased ALT (2.9%) and increased AST (2.5%).\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) were diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain,\nnausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity, and cough.

Coadministration of LUMAKRAS with gastric\nacid-reducing agents decreased sotorasib concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology\n(12.3)], which may reduce the efficacy of sotorasib. Avoid coadministration of\nLUMAKRAS with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H  receptor antagonists, and locally\nacting antacids. If coadministration with an acid-reducing agent cannot be avoided,\nadminister LUMAKRAS 4 hours before or 10 hours after administration of a locally acting\nantacid [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\nStrong CYP3A4 Inducers\nSotorasib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Coadministration of LUMAKRAS with a strong CYP3A4\ninducer decreased sotorasib concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which\nmay reduce the efficacy of sotorasib. Avoid coadministration of LUMAKRAS with strong\nCYP3A4 inducers.\n7.2 Effects of LUMAKRAS on Other Drugs\nCYP3A4 Substrates\nSotorasib is a CYP3A4 inducer. Coadministration of LUMAKRAS with a CYP3A4 substrate\ndecreased its plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may\nreduce the efficacy of the substrate. Avoid coadministration of LUMAKRAS with CYP3A4\nsensitive substrates, for which minimal concentration changes may lead to therapeutic\nfailures of the substrate. If coadministration cannot be avoided, increase the sensitive\nCYP3A4 substrate dosage in accordance with its Prescribing Information.\nP-glycoprotein (P-gp) Substrates\nSotorasib is a P-gp inhibitor. Coadministration of LUMAKRAS with a P-gp substrate\nincreased its plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may\nincrease the adverse reactions of the substrate. Avoid coadministration of LUMAKRAS\nwith P-gp substrates, for which minimal concentration changes may lead to serious\ntoxicities. If coadministration cannot be avoided, decrease the P-gp substrate dosage in\naccordance with its Prescribing Information.\nBreast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) Substrates\nSotorasib is a BCRP-inhibitor. Coadministration of LUMAKRAS with a BCRP substrate\nincreased its plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may\nincrease the risk of adverse reactions of the substrate. When coadministered with\nN = number of patients who had at least one on-study assessment for the\nparameter of interest.\n2\nLUMAKRAS, monitor for adverse reactions of the BCRP substrate and decrease the\nBCRP substrate dosage in accordance with its Prescribing Information.\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nThere are no available data on LUMAKRAS use in pregnant women. In rat and rabbit\nembryo-fetal development studies, oral sotorasib did not cause adverse developmental\neffects or embryo-lethality at exposures up to 4.6 times the human exposure at the 960\nmg clinical dose (see Data).\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nIn a rat embryo-fetal development study, once daily oral administration of sotorasib to\npregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity at the\n540 mg/kg dose level (approximately 4.6 times the human exposure based on area\nunder the curve (AUC) at the clinical dose of 960 mg). Sotorasib did not cause adverse\ndevelopmental effects and did not affect embryo-fetal survival at doses up to 540\nmg/kg.\nIn a rabbit embryo-fetal development study, once daily oral administration of sotorasib\nduring the period of organogenesis resulted in lower fetal body weights and a reduction\nin the number of ossified metacarpals in fetuses at the 100 mg/kg dose level\n(approximately 2.6 times the human exposure based on AUC at the clinical dose of 960\nmg), which was associated with maternal toxicity including decreased body weight gain\nand food consumption during the dosing phase. Sotorasib did not cause adverse\ndevelopmental effects and did not affect embryo-fetal survival at doses up to 100\nmg/kg.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of sotorasib or its metabolites in human milk, the\neffects on the breastfed child, or on milk production. Because of the potential for\nserious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during\ntreatment with LUMAKRAS and for 1-week after the final dose.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of LUMAKRAS have not been established in pediatric\npatients.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the 357 patients with any tumor type who received LUMAKRAS 960 mg orally once\ndaily in CodeBreaK 100, 46% were 65 and over, and 10% were 75 and over. No overall\ndifferences in safety or effectiveness were observed between older patients and\nyounger patients.\n8.6 Hepatic Impairment\nNo dosage modification is recommended in patients with mild to moderate hepatic\nimpairment (Child-Pugh A or B).\nThe effect of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) on the safety of LUMAKRAS is\nunknown. Monitor for sotorasib adverse reactions in patients with hepatic impairment\nmore frequently since these patients may be at increased risk for adverse reactions\nincluding hepatotoxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n11 DESCRIPTION\nSotorasib is an inhibitor of the RAS GTPase family. The molecular formula is\nC\nH\nF N O , and the molecular weight is 560.6 g/mol. The chemical name of sotorasib\nis 6-fluoro-7-(2-fluoro-6-hydroxyphenyl)-(1M)-1-[4-methyl-2-(propan-2-yl)pyridin-3-yl]-4-\n[(2S)-2-methyl-4-(prop-2-enoyl)piperazin-1-yl]pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one.\nThe chemical structure of sotorasib is shown below:\nSotorasib has pKa values of 8.06 and 4.56. The solubility of sotorasib in the aqueous\nmedia decreases over the range pH 1.2 to 6.8 from 1.3 mg/mL to 0.03 mg/mL.\nLUMAKRAS is supplied as film-coated tablets for oral use containing 320 mg, 240 mg or\n120 mg of sotorasib. Inactive ingredients in the tablet core are microcrystalline cellulose,\nlactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate. The film coating\nmaterial consists of polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, talc iron oxide\nyellow and iron oxide red (320 mg tablet only).\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\n30\n30 2\n6\n3\nSotorasib is an inhibitor of KRAS\n, a tumor-restricted, mutant-oncogenic form of the\nRAS GTPase, KRAS. Sotorasib forms an irreversible, covalent bond with the unique\ncysteine of KRAS\n, locking the protein in an inactive state that prevents downstream\nsignaling without affecting wild-type KRAS. Sotorasib blocked KRAS signaling, inhibited\ncell growth, and promoted apoptosis only in KRAS G12C tumor cell lines. Sotorasib\ninhibited KRAS\nin vitro and in vivo with minimal detectable off-target activity. In\nmouse tumor xenograft models, sotorasib-treatment led to tumor regressions and\nprolonged survival, and was associated with anti-tumor immunity in KRAS G12C models.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nSotorasib exposure-response relationships and the time course of the\npharmacodynamic response are unknown.\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nAt the approved recommended dosage, LUMAKRAS does not cause large mean\nincreases in the QTc interval (> 20 msec).\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of sotorasib have been characterized in healthy subjects and in\npatients with KRAS G12C-mutated solid tumors, including NSCLC. Sotorasib exhibited\nnon-linear, time-dependent, pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 180 mg to 960 mg\n(0.19 to 1 time the approved recommended dosage) once daily with similar systemic\nexposure (i.e., AUC\n and C\n) across doses at steady state. Sotorasib systemic\nexposure was comparable between film-coated tablets and film-coated tablets\npredispersed in water administered under fasted conditions. Sotorasib plasma\nconcentrations reached steady state within 22 days. No accumulation was observed\nafter repeat LUMAKRAS dosages with a mean accumulation ratio of 0.56 (coefficient of\nvariation (CV): 59%).\nAbsorption\nThe median time to sotorasib peak plasma concentration is 1 hour.\nEffect of Food\nWhen 960 mg LUMAKRAS was administered with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (containing\napproximately 800 to 1000 calories with 150, 250, and 500 to 600 calories from protein,\ncarbohydrate and fat, respectively) in patients, sotorasib AUC\n increased by 25%\ncompared to administration under fasted conditions.\nDistribution\nThe sotorasib mean volume of distribution (V ) at steady state is 211 L (CV: 135%). In\nvitro, sotorasib plasma protein binding is 89%.\nElimination\nThe sotorasib mean terminal elimination half-life is 5 hours (standard deviation (SD): 2).\nAt 960 mg LUMAKRAS once daily, the sotorasib steady state apparent clearance is 26.2\nL/hr (CV: 76%).\nMetabolism\nG12C\nG12C\nG12C \n0-24h\nmax\n0-24h\nd\nThe main metabolic pathways of sotorasib are non-enzymatic conjugation and oxidative\nmetabolism with CYP3As.\nExcretion\nAfter a single dose of radiolabeled sotorasib, 74% of the dose was recovered in feces\n(53% unchanged) and 6% (1% unchanged) in urine.\nSpecific Populations\nNo clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of sotorasib were observed\nbased on age (28 to 86 years), sex, race (White, Black and Asian), body weight (36.8 to\n157.9 kg), line of therapy, ECOG PS (0, 1), mild and moderate renal impairment (eGFR: \u2265\n30 mL/min/1.73 m ), or mild hepatic impairment (AST or ALT < 2.5 \u00d7 ULN or total\nbilirubin < 1.5 \u00d7 ULN). The effect of severe renal impairment on sotorasib\npharmacokinetics has not been studied.\nHepatic Impairment\nThe mean AUC of sotorasib decreased by 25% in subjects with moderate hepatic\nimpairment (Child-Pugh B) and increased by 4% in subjects with severe hepatic\nimpairment (Child-Pugh C) compared to subjects with normal hepatic function following a\nsingle dose of 960 mg LUMAKRAS.\nDrug Interaction Studies\nClinical Studies\nAcid-Reducing Agents: Coadministration of repeat doses of omeprazole (PPI) with a\nsingle dose of LUMAKRAS decreased sotorasib C\n by 65% and AUC by 57% under fed\nconditions, and decreased sotorasib C\n by 57% and AUC by 42% under fasted\nconditions. Coadministration of a single dose of famotidine (H  receptor antagonist)\ngiven 10 hours prior to and 2 hours after a single dose of LUMAKRAS under fed\nconditions decreased sotorasib C\n by 35% and AUC by 38%.\nStrong CYP3A4 Inducers: Coadministration of repeat doses of rifampin (a strong\nCYP3A4 inducer) with a single dose of LUMAKRAS decreased sotorasib C\nby 35% and\nAUC by 51%.\nOther Drugs: No clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of sotorasib was observed\nfollowing coadministration of LUMAKRAS with itraconazole (a combined strong CYP3A4\nand P-gp inhibitor) and a single dose of rifampin (an OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitor), or\nmetformin (a MATE1/MATE2-K substrate).\nCYP3A4 substrates: Coadministration of LUMAKRAS with midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4\nsubstrate) decreased midazolam C\n by 48% and AUC by 53%.\nP-gp substrates: Coadministration of LUMAKRAS with digoxin (a P-gp substrate)\nincreased digoxin C\n by 91% and AUC by 21%.\nMATE1/MATE2-K substrates: No clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of\nmetformin (a MATE1/MATE2-K substrate) was observed following coadministration of\nLUMAKRAS.\nBCRP substrates: Coadministration of LUMAKRAS with rosuvastatin (a BCRP substrate)\nincreased rosuvastatin C\n by 70% and AUC by 34%.\nIn Vitro Studies\n2\nmax\nmax\n2\nmax\nmax \nmax\nmax\nmax\nCytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: Sotorasib may induce CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2B6.\nSotorasib does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed with sotorasib.\nSotorasib was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and\nwas not genotoxic in the in vivo rat micronucleus and comet assays.\nFertility/early embryonic development studies were not conducted with sotorasib. There\nwere no adverse effects on female or male reproductive organs in general toxicology\nstudies conducted in dogs and rats.\n13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nIn rats, renal toxicity including minimal to marked histologic tubular\ndegeneration/necrosis and increased kidney weight, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and\nurinary biomarkers of renal tubular injury were present at doses resulting in exposures\napproximately \u2265 0.5 times the human AUC at the clinical dose of 960 mg. Increases in\ncysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase pathway metabolism in the rat kidney compared to human\nmay make rats more susceptible to renal toxicity due to local formation of a putative\nsulfur-containing metabolite than humans.\nIn the 3-month toxicology study in dogs, sotorasib induced findings in the liver\n(centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy), pituitary gland (hypertrophy of basophils),\nand thyroid gland (marked follicular cell atrophy, moderate to marked colloid depletion,\nand follicular cell hypertrophy) at exposures approximately 0.4 times the human\nexposure based on AUC at the clinical dose of 960 mg. These findings may be due to an\nadaptive response to hepatocellular enzyme induction and subsequent reduced thyroid\nhormone levels (i.e., secondary hypothyroidism). Although thyroid levels were not\nmeasured in dogs, induction of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase known to\nbe involved in thyroid hormone metabolism was confirmed in the in vitro dog hepatocyte\nassay.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of LUMAKRAS was demonstrated in a subset of patients enrolled in a single-\narm, open-label, multicenter trial (CodeBreaK 100 [NCT03600883]). Eligible patients were\nrequired to have locally advanced or metastatic KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC with\ndisease progression after receiving an immune checkpoint inhibitor and/or platinum-\nbased chemotherapy, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status\n(ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, and at least one measurable lesion as defined by Response\nEvaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1).\nAll patients were required to have prospectively identified KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC in\ntumor tissue samples by using the QIAGEN therascreen\n KRAS RGQ PCR Kit performed\nin a central laboratory. Of 126 total enrolled subjects, 2 (2%) were unevaluable for\nefficacy analysis due to the absence of radiographically measurable lesions at baseline.\n\u00ae\nOf the 124 patients with KRAS G12C mutations confirmed in tumor tissue, plasma\nsamples from 112 patients were tested retrospectively using the Guardant360\nCDx.\n78/112 patients (70%) had KRAS G12C mutation identified in plasma specimen, 31/112\npatients (28%) did not have KRAS G12C mutation identified in plasma specimen and\n3/112 (2%) were unevaluable due to Guardant360\nCDx test failure.\nA total of 124 patients had at least one measurable lesion at baseline assessed by\nBlinded Independent Central Review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1 and were treated\nwith LUMAKRAS 960 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\nThe major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration\nof response (DOR) as evaluated by BICR according to RECIST v1.1.\nThe baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the study population were:\nmedian age 64 years (range: 37 to 80) with 48% \u2265 65 years and 8% \u2265 75 years; 50%\nFemale; 82% White, 15% Asian, 2% Black; 70% ECOG PS 1; 96% had stage IV disease;\n99% with non-squamous histology; 81% former smokers, 12% current smokers, 5%\nnever smokers. All patients received at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy for\nmetastatic NSCLC; 43% received only 1 prior line of therapy, 35% received 2 prior lines\nof therapy, 23% received 3 prior lines of therapy; 91% received prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1\nimmunotherapy, 90% received prior platinum-based chemotherapy, 81% received both\nplatinum-based chemotherapy and anti-PD-1/PD-L1. The sites of known extra-thoracic\nmetastasis included 48% bone, 21% brain, and 21% liver.\nEfficacy results are summarized in Table 5.\nTable 5.

Discard diluted solution if not used within 8\nhours from the time of preparation; or\n\u2022     under refrigeration at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) and protected from light for\nno more than 7 days from the time of preparation to end of infusion. Discard\ndiluted solution if not used within 7 days from the time of preparation.\nDo not freeze.\nAdminister the infusion, after dilution, over 30 minutes through an intravenous line\ncontaining a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding in-line filter (pore size of 0.2\nmicrometer to 1.2 micrometer).\nAdminister OPDIVO in combination with other therapeutic agents as follows:\n\u2022\n\u2022\nWith ipilimumab: administer OPDIVO first followed by ipilimumab on the same\nday.\nWith platinum-doublet chemotherapy: administer OPDIVO first followed by\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nInjection: 40 mg/4 mL (10 mg/mL), 100 mg/10 mL (10 mg/mL), 120 mg/12 mL (10\nmg/mL), and 240 mg/24 mL (10 mg/mL) clear to opalescent, colorless to pale-yellow\nsolution in a single-dose vial.\n4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nNone.\n5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n5.1 Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions\nOPDIVO is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the\nprogrammed death-receptor 1 (PD-1) or the PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-\nL1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking\nperipheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Important\nimmune-mediated adverse reactions listed under Warnings and Precautions may not\ninclude all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions.\nImmune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any\norgan system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time\nafter starting treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. While immune-mediated\nadverse reactions usually manifest during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking\nantibodies, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation\nof PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies.\nEarly identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are\nessential to ensure safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor patients closely\nfor symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-\nmediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at\nbaseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated\nadverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including\ninfection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as\nappropriate.\nWithhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO depending on severity [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3)].

If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-\nmediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this\nmay require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision\nloss\nGastrointestinal: Pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels,\ngastritis, duodenitis\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis, and\nassociated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic\nEndocrine: Hypoparathyroidism\nOther (Hematologic/Immune): Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic\nlymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing\nlymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura,\nsolid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection\n5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions\nOPDIVO can cause severe infusion-related reactions, which have been reported in\n<1.0% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with severe or life-\nthreatening infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients\nwith mild or moderate infusion-related reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\nOPDIVO as a Single Agent\nIn patients who received OPDIVO as a 60-minute intravenous infusion, infusion-related\nreactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients.\nIn a trial assessing the pharmacokinetics and safety of a more rapid infusion, in which\npatients received OPDIVO as a 60-minute intravenous infusion or a 30-minute\nintravenous infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7%\n(10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of\npatients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led\nto dose delay, permanent discontinuation, or withholding of OPDIVO.\nOPDIVO with Ipilimumab\nOPDIVO 1 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg\nInfusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients with melanoma and in\n8% (4/49) of patients with HCC who received OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg\nevery 3 weeks.\nOPDIVO 3 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg\nInfusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients with RCC and 4.2%\n(5/119) of patients with CRC who received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg\nevery 3 weeks, respectively. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 12% (37/300) of\npatients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2\nweeks with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks.\n5.3 Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation\nFatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic\nhematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1\nreceptor blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-\nversus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive\ndisease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile\nsyndrome (without an identified infectious cause) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. These\ncomplications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and\nallogeneic HSCT.\nFollow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene\npromptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1 receptor blocking\nantibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.\n5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, OPDIVO can cause fetal\nharm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies,\nadministration of nivolumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis\nthrough delivery resulted in increased abortion and premature infant death. Advise\npregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential\nto use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and for 5 months after the\nlast dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].\n5.5 Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO Is\nAdded to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone\nIn randomized clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of a PD-1\nblocking antibody, including OPDIVO, to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, a\nuse for which no PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody is indicated, resulted in increased\nmortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking\nantibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not\nrecommended outside of controlled clinical trials.\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the\nlabeling.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe data in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to OPDIVO as a single\nagent in 1994 patients enrolled in CHECKMATE-037, CHECKMATE-017, CHECKMATE-057,\nCHECKMATE-066, CHECKMATE-025, CHECKMATE-067, CHECKMATE-205, CHECKMATE-\n039 or a single-arm trial in NSCLC (n=117); OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in\npatients enrolled in CHECKMATE-067 (n=313), CHECKMATE-040 (n=49), or another\nrandomized trial (n=94); OPDIVO 3 mg/kg administered with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg\n(n=666) in patients enrolled in CHECKMATE-214 or CHECKMATE-142; OPDIVO 3 mg/kg\nevery 2 weeks with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks in patients enrolled in\nCHECKMATE-227 (n=576) or CHECKMATE-743 (n=300); OPDIVO 360 mg with\nipilimumab 1 mg/kg and 2 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy in CHECKMATE-9LA\n(n=361); and OPDIVO 240 mg with cabozantinib 40 mg in patients enrolled in\nCHECKMATE-9ER (n=320).\nUnresectable or Metastatic Melanoma\nPreviously Treated Metastatic Melanoma\nThe safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in CHECKMATE-037, a randomized, open-label trial\nin 370 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].\nPatients had documented disease progression following treatment with ipilimumab and,\nif BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. The trial excluded patients with\nautoimmune disease, prior ipilimumab-related Grade 4 adverse reactions (except for\nendocrinopathies) or Grade 3 ipilimumab-related adverse reactions that had not resolved\nor were inadequately controlled within 12 weeks of the initiating event, patients with a\ncondition requiring chronic systemic treatment with corticosteroids (>10 mg daily\nprednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications, a positive test for\nhepatitis B or C, and a history of HIV. Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous\ninfusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks (n=268) or investigator\u2019s choice of\nchemotherapy (n=102): dacarbazine 1000 mg/m  intravenously every 3 weeks or\ncarboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min and paclitaxel 175 mg/m  intravenously every 3 weeks.\nThe median duration of exposure was 5.3 months (range: 1 day to 13.8+ months) in\nOPDIVO-treated patients and was 2 months (range: 1 day to 9.6+ months) in\nchemotherapy-treated patients. In this ongoing trial, 24% of patients received OPDIVO\nSevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and\nPrecautions (5.1)]\nInfusion-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nComplications of Allogeneic HSCT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n2\n2\nfor >6 months and 3% of patients received OPDIVO for >1 year.\nThe population characteristics in the OPDIVO group and the chemotherapy group were\nsimilar: 66% male, median age 59.5 years, 98% White, baseline Eastern Cooperative\nOncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 (59%) or 1 (41%), 74% with M1c stage\ndisease, 73% with cutaneous melanoma, 11% with mucosal melanoma, 73% received\ntwo or more prior therapies for advanced or metastatic disease, and 18% had brain\nmetastasis. There were more patients in the OPDIVO group with elevated lactate\ndehydrogenase (LDH) at baseline (51% vs. 38%).\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO. OPDIVO was\ndiscontinued for adverse reactions in 9% of patients. Twenty-six percent of patients\nreceiving OPDIVO had a dose interruption for an adverse reaction. Grade 3 and 4\nadverse reactions occurred in 42% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent\nGrade 3 and 4 adverse reactions reported in 2% to <5% of patients receiving OPDIVO\nwere abdominal pain, hyponatremia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and\nincreased lipase.

The trial excluded\npatients with autoimmune disease and patients requiring chronic systemic treatment\nwith corticosteroids (>10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive\nmedications. Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 60\nminutes every 2 weeks (n=206) or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m  intravenously every 3\nweeks (n=205). The median duration of exposure was 6.5 months (range: 1 day to 16.6\nmonths) in OPDIVO-treated patients.

There were more patients in the OPDIVO group with\nECOG performance status 0 (71% vs. 59%).\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients receiving OPDIVO. Adverse\nreactions led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in 7% of patients and dose\ninterruption in 26% of patients; no single type of adverse reaction accounted for the\nmajority of OPDIVO discontinuations. Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 41%\nof patients receiving OPDIVO.\nThe most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions reported in \u22652% of patients\nreceiving OPDIVO were increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (3.9%) and diarrhea\n(3.4%).

Among patients who received OPDIVO and chemotherapy, 54% were\nexposed for >6 months and 28% were exposed for >1 year.\nFatal adverse reactions occurred in 16 (2.0%) patients who were treated with OPDIVO in\ncombination with chemotherapy; these included pneumonitis (4 patients), febrile\nneutropenia (2 patients), stroke (2 patients), gastrointestinal toxicity, intestinal\nmucositis, septic shock, pneumonia, infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, mesenteric\nvessel thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Serious adverse\nreactions occurred in 52% of patients treated with OPDIVO in combination with\na\nOPDIVO 240 mg in combination with mFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin and\noxaliplatin) every 2 weeks or mFOLFOX6 every 2 weeks.\nOPDIVO 360 mg in combination with CapeOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) every 3\nweeks or CapeOX every 3 weeks.\nchemotherapy. OPDIVO and/or chemotherapy were discontinued in 44% of patients and\nat least one dose was withheld in 76% of patients due to an adverse reaction.\nThe most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in \u22652% of patients treated with\nOPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy were vomiting (3.7%), pneumonia (3.6%),\nanemia (3.6%), pyrexia (2.8%), diarrhea (2.7%), febrile neutropenia (2.6%), and\npneumonitis (2.4%).

In animal reproduction studies, administration of nivolumab to cynomolgus\nmonkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in increased\nabortion and premature infant death (see Data). Human IgG4 is known to cross the\nplacental barrier and nivolumab is an immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4); therefore, nivolumab\nhas the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. The effects\nof OPDIVO are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.\nThere are no available data on OPDIVO use in pregnant women to evaluate a drug-\nassociated risk. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.\nThe background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4%\nand of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.\nData\nAnimal Data\nA central function of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is to preserve pregnancy by maintaining\nmaternal immune tolerance to the fetus. Blockade of PD-L1 signaling has been shown in\nmurine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the fetus and to increase fetal loss.\nThe effects of nivolumab on prenatal and postnatal development were evaluated in\nmonkeys that received nivolumab twice weekly from the onset of organogenesis\na\nthrough delivery, at exposure levels of between 9 and 42 times higher than those\nobserved at the clinical dose of 3 mg/kg (based on AUC). Nivolumab administration\nresulted in a non-dose-related increase in spontaneous abortion and increased neonatal\ndeath. Based on its mechanism of action, fetal exposure to nivolumab may increase the\nrisk of developing immune-mediated disorders or altering the normal immune response\nand immune-mediated disorders have been reported in PD-1 knockout mice. In surviving\ninfants (18 of 32 compared to 11 of 16 vehicle-exposed infants) of cynomolgus\nmonkeys treated with nivolumab, there were no apparent malformations and no effects\non neurobehavioral, immunological, or clinical pathology parameters throughout the 6-\nmonth postnatal period.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of nivolumab in human milk, the effects on the\nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious\nadverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during\ntreatment and for 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating\nOPDIVO [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nContraception\nOPDIVO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective\ncontraception during treatment with OPDIVO and for 5 months following the last dose.\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of OPDIVO have been established in pediatric patients aged\n12 years and older for the following indications: as a single agent and in combination\nwith ipilimumab for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma, as a single\nagent for the adjuvant treatment of completely resected Stage IIB, Stage IIC, Stage III,\nor Stage IV melanoma and, as a single agent or in combination with ipilimumab for the\ntreatment of MSI-H or dMMR mCRC that has progressed following treatment with a\nfluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Use of OPDIVO for these indications is\nsupported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with\nmelanoma or MSI-H or dMMR mCRC and additional pharmacokinetic data in pediatric\npatients. Nivolumab exposure in pediatric patients 12 years and older is comparable to\nthat of adults and the courses of melanoma and MSI-H or dMMR mCRC are similar in\npediatric patients aged 12 years and older to that of adults to allow extrapolation of\nsafety and efficacy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical\nStudies (14.1, 14.10)].\nThe safety and effectiveness of OPDIVO have not been established for pediatric patients\nyounger than 12 years old with melanoma or MSI-H or dMMR mCRC.\nThe safety and effectiveness of OPDIVO have not been established in pediatric patients\nwith non-small cell lung cancer, malignant pleural mesothelioma, advanced renal cell\ncarcinoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck,\nurothelial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer,\ngastroesophageal cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nSingle Agent\nOf 3569 patients with melanoma, NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma,\nESCC, and esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer who were randomized to\nsingle agent OPDIVO in clinical studies, 41% were 65 years and over and 10% were 75\nyears and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between\nelderly patients and younger patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2, 14.4, 14.6, 14.9,\n14.12)].\nIn patients with cHL, recurrent head and neck SCC, or dMMR or MSI-H metastatic CRC\n(mCRC) who were treated with single agent OPDIVO in clinical studies did not include\nsufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they\nrespond differently from younger patients [see Clinical Studies (14.7, 14.8, 14.10)].\nIn Combination with Ipilimumab\nOf the 314 patients with melanoma who were randomized to OPDIVO in combination\nwith ipilimumab, 41% were 65 years or older and 11% were 75 years or older. No overall\ndifferences in safety or effectiveness were reported between elderly patients and\nyounger patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].\nOf the 576 patients with NSCLC who were randomized to OPDIVO in combination with\nipilimumab, 48% were 65 years or older and 10% were 75 years or older. No overall\ndifference in safety was reported between older patients and younger patients;\nhowever, there was a higher discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions in patients\naged 75 years or older (29%) relative to all patients who received OPDIVO with\nipilimumab (18%). Of the 396 patients in the primary efficacy population (PD-L1 \u22651%)\nrandomized to OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab, the hazard ratio for overall\nsurvival was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.89) in the 199 patients younger than 65 years\ncompared to 0.91 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.15) in the 197 patients 65 years or older [see Clinical\nStudies (14.3)].\nOf the 303 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who were randomized to\nOPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab, 77% were 65 years old or older and 26% were\n75 years or older. No overall difference in safety was reported between older patients\nand younger patients; however, there were higher rates of serious adverse reactions\nand discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients aged 75 years or older (68%\nand 35%, respectively) relative to all patients who received OPDIVO with ipilimumab (54%\nand 28%, respectively). For patients aged 75 years or older who received\nchemotherapy, the rate of serious adverse reactions was 34% and the discontinuation\nrate due to adverse reactions was 26% relative to 28% and 19% respectively for all\npatients. The hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.52, 1.11) in the 71\npatients younger than 65 years compared to 0.74 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.93) in the 232\npatients 65 years or older randomized to OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab [see\nClinical Studies (14.5)].\nOf the 550 patients with renal cell carcinoma who were randomized to OPDIVO in\ncombination with ipilimumab, 38% were 65 years or older and 8% were 75 years or\nolder. No overall difference in safety was reported between elderly patients and younger\npatients. In elderly patients with intermediate or poor risk, no overall difference in\neffectiveness was reported [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].\nOf the 49 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were treated with OPDIVO in\ncombination with ipilimumab, 29% were between 65 years and 74 years of age and 8%\nwere 75 years or older. Clinical studies of OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab did not\ninclude sufficient numbers of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma aged 65 and over to\ndetermine whether they respond differently from younger patients [see Clinical Studies\n(14.11)].\nOf the 325 patients with ESCC who were randomized to OPDIVO in combination with\nipilimumab, 43% were 65 years old or older and 7% were 75 years or older. No overall\ndifference in safety was reported between older patients and younger patients;\nhowever, there was a higher discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions in patients\naged 75 years or older (38%) relative to all patients who received OPDIVO with\nipilimumab (23%). For patients aged 75 years or older who received chemotherapy, the\ndiscontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 33% relative to 23% for all patients\n[see Clinical Studies (14.12)].\nIn Combination with Platinum-Containing Chemotherapy\nOf the 179 patients with NSCLC who were randomized to OPDIVO in combination with\nplatinum-doublet chemotherapy, 48% were 65 years old or older and 6% were 75 years\nold or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were reported between\npatients older and younger than 65 years [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].\nOf the 1,110 patients with ESCC, GC, GEJC, or EAC who were randomized to OPDIVO in\ncombination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy), 42% were\n65 years or older and 10% were 75 years or older. No overall difference in safety was\nreported between elderly patients and younger patients [see Clinical Studies (14.12,\n14.13)].\nOf the 304 patients with UC who were treated with OPDIVO in combination with\ngemcitabine and platinum-doublet chemotherapy, 40% were 65 years or older and 11%\nwere 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed\nbetween patients 65 years of age and over and younger patients. Clinical studies of\nOPDIVO with platinum-doublet chemotherapy did not include sufficient numbers of\npatients aged 75 years and over to determine whether safety and effectiveness differs\ncompared to younger patients. [see Clinical Studies (14.9)].\nIn Combination with Ipilimumab and Platinum-Doublet Chemotherapy\nOf the 361 patients with NSCLC who were randomized to OPDIVO in combination with\nipilimumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy, 51% were 65 years or older and 10%\nwere 75 years or older. No overall difference in safety was reported between older\npatients and younger patients; however, there was a higher discontinuation rate due to\nadverse reactions in patients aged 75 years or older (43%) relative to all patients who\nreceived OPDIVO with ipilimumab and chemotherapy (24%). For patients aged 75 years\nor older who received chemotherapy only, the discontinuation rate due to adverse\nreactions was 16% relative to all patients who had a discontinuation rate of 13%. Based\non an updated analysis for overall survival, of the 361 patients randomized to OPDIVO in\ncombination with ipilimumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy, the hazard ratio for\noverall survival was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.80) in the 176 patients younger than 65 years\ncompared to 0.73 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.95) in the 185 patients 65 years or older [see Clinical\nStudies (14.4)].\nIn Combination with Cabozantinib\nOf the 320 patients with renal cell carcinoma who were treated with OPDIVO in\ncombination with cabozantinib, 41% were 65 years or older and 9% were 75 years or\nolder. No overall difference in safety was reported between elderly patients and younger\npatients [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].\n11 DESCRIPTION\nNivolumab is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody. Nivolumab is an\nIgG4 kappa immunoglobulin that has a calculated molecular mass of 146 kDa. It is\nexpressed in a recombinant Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line.\nOPDIVO is a sterile, preservative-free, non-pyrogenic, clear to opalescent, colorless to\npale-yellow liquid that may contain light (few) particles.\nOPDIVO (nivolumab) injection for intravenous use is supplied in single-dose vials. Each\nmL of OPDIVO solution contains nivolumab 10 mg, mannitol (30 mg), pentetic acid\n(0.008 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.2 mg), sodium chloride (2.92 mg), sodium citrate\ndihydrate (5.88 mg), and Water for Injection, USP. May contain hydrochloric acid and/or\nsodium hydroxide to adjust pH to 6.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nBinding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells,\ninhibits T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs\nin some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active\nT-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)\nmonoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-\nL1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response,\nincluding the anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking\nPD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth.\nCombined nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) mediated inhibition results\nin enhanced T-cell function that is greater than the effects of either antibody alone, and\nresults in improved anti-tumor responses in metastatic melanoma and advanced RCC. In\nmurine syngeneic tumor models, dual blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 resulted in\nincreased anti-tumor activity.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nThere are no clinically significant exposure-response relationships for efficacy or safety\nfor nivolumab monotherapy across the approved dosing regimens, regardless of cancer\ntype.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nNivolumab pharmacokinetics (PK) was assessed using a population PK approach for\nboth single agent OPDIVO and OPDIVO with ipilimumab. The PK of nivolumab was\nstudied in patients over a dose range of 0.1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg administered as a single\ndose or as multiple doses of OPDIVO as a 60-minute intravenous infusion every 2 or 3\nweeks. The exposure to nivolumab increases dose proportionally over the dose range of\n0.1 to 10 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks. The predicted exposure of nivolumab after\na 30-minute infusion is comparable to that observed with a 60-minute infusion. Steady-\nstate concentrations of nivolumab were reached by 12 weeks when administered at 3\nmg/kg every 2 weeks, and systemic accumulation was 3.7-fold.\nDistribution\nThe geometric mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) and coefficient of\nvariation (CV%) is 6.8 L (27.3%).\nElimination\nNivolumab clearance (CL) decreases over time, with a mean maximal reduction from\nbaseline values (CV%) of 24.5% (47.6%) resulting in a geometric mean steady-state\nclearance (CLss) (CV%) of 8.2 mL/h (53.9%) in patients with metastatic tumors; the\ndecrease in CLss is not considered clinically relevant. Nivolumab clearance does not\ndecrease over time in patients with completely resected melanoma, as the geometric\nmean population clearance is 24% lower in this patient population compared with\npatients with metastatic melanoma at steady state.\nThe geometric mean elimination half-life (t\n) is 25 days (77.5%).\nSpecific Populations\nThe following factors had no clinically important effect on the clearance of nivolumab:\nage (29 to 87 years), weight (35 to 160 kg), sex, race, baseline LDH, PD-L1 expression,\nsolid tumor type, tumor size, renal impairment (eGFR \u2265 15 mL/min/1.73 m ), and mild\n(total bilirubin [TB] less than or equal to the ULN and AST greater than ULN or TB greater\nthan 1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) or moderate hepatic impairment (TB greater than\n1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST). Nivolumab has not been studied in patients with\nsevere hepatic impairment (TB greater than 3 times ULN and any AST).\nPediatric Patients\nThe exposures of nivolumab in pediatric patients 12 years of age or older are\ncomparable to those in adults at the recommended dosage [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.2)].\nDrug Interaction Studies\nWhen OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks was administered in combination with ipilimumab\n1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, the CL of nivolumab and ipilimumab were unchanged compared\nto nivolumab or ipilimumab administered alone.\nWhen OPDIVO 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks was administered in combination with ipilimumab\n3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, the CL of nivolumab was increased by 29% compared to\nOPDIVO administered alone and the CL of ipilimumab was unchanged compared to\nipilimumab administered alone.\nWhen OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks was administered in combination with ipilimumab\n1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, the CL of nivolumab was unchanged compared to OPDIVO\n1/2\n2\nadministered alone and the CL of ipilimumab was increased by 30% compared to\nipilimumab administered alone.\nWhen OPDIVO 360 mg every 3 weeks was administered in combination with ipilimumab\n1 mg/kg every 6 weeks and chemotherapy, the CL of nivolumab was unchanged\ncompared to OPDIVO administered alone and the CL of ipilimumab increased by 22%\ncompared to ipilimumab administered alone.\n12.6 Immunogenicity\nThe observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and\nspecificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons\nof the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence\nof anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of OPDIVO or of other\nnivolumab products.\nAnti-drug antibody and neutralizing antibody responses were monitored throughout the\ntreatment period where the benefit to risk ratio was assessed. Incidence of anti-drug\nantibodies and neutralizing antibodies are presented in Table 51.\nTable 51: OPDIVO Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) and Neutralizing Antibody (NAb)\nIncidence\n Details of each treatment regimen are described in Section 14 [see Clinical Studies\n(14)].\n NAb incidence is reported among the subset of patients positive for ADA.\n Includes unresectable or metastatic melanoma, metastatic NSCLC, advanced RCC,\ncHL, recurrent or metastatic SCCHN, and UC indications.\nADA = treatment-emergent anti-nivolumab antibodies, NAb = neutralizing antibodies,\nHCC = hepatocellular carcinoma, RCC = renal cell carcinoma, CRC = colorectal cancer,\nNSCLC = non-small cell lung cancer.\nTreatment Regimen\nIndication(s)\nADA\nNAb\nOPDIVO as a single agent\nMultiple\n11%\n(229/2,085)\n7%\n(15/229)\nOPDIVO with ipilimumab for 4 doses followed\nby OPDIVO as a single agent\nMelanoma\n38%\n(149/394)\n12%\n(18/149)\nHCC\n56%\n(27/48)\n41%\n(11/27)\nRCC and CRC\n26%\n(132/516)\n3%\n(4/132)\nOPDIVO with ipilimumab\nMalignant Pleural\nMesothelioma\n26%\n(69/269)\n2.9%\n(2/69)\nNSCLC\n37%\n(180/491)\n3.9%\n(7/180)\nOPDIVO with ipilimumab and 2 cycles of\nplatinum\u2011doublet chemotherapy\nNSCLC\n34%\n(104/308)\n8%\n(8/104)\nEffects of Anti-Drug Antibodies\nPresence of treatment-emergent anti-nivolumab antibodies increased nivolumab\nclearance by up to 20% after administration of nivolumab as monotherapy or in\na\nb\nc\na\nb\nc\ncombination with ipilimumab. These anti-drug antibody-associated pharmacokinetic\nchanges were not considered to be clinically significant. There was no identified clinically\nsignificant effect of anti-drug antibodies on incidence of infusion-related reactions. The\neffects of anti-drug antibodies on effectiveness have not been fully characterized.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nNo studies have been performed to assess the potential of nivolumab for carcinogenicity\nor genotoxicity. Fertility studies have not been performed with nivolumab. In 1-month\nand 3-month repeat-dose toxicology studies in monkeys, there were no notable effects\nin the male and female reproductive organs; however, most animals in these studies\nwere not sexually mature.\n13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nIn animal models, inhibition of PD-1 signaling increased the severity of some infections\nand enhanced inflammatory responses. M. tuberculosis\u2013infected PD-1 knockout mice\nexhibit markedly decreased survival compared with wild-type controls, which correlated\nwith increased bacterial proliferation and inflammatory responses in these animals. PD-1\nknockout mice have also shown decreased survival following infection with lymphocytic\nchoriomeningitis virus.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma\nPreviously Treated Metastatic Melanoma\nCHECKMATE-037 (NCT01721746) was a multicenter, open-label trial that randomized\n(2:1) patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma to receive OPDIVO 3 mg/kg\nintravenously every 2 weeks or investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy, either single-\nagent dacarbazine 1000 mg/m  every 3 weeks or the combination of carboplatin AUC 6\nintravenously every 3 weeks and paclitaxel 175 mg/m  intravenously every 3 weeks.\nPatients were required to have progression of disease on or following ipilimumab\ntreatment and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. The trial excluded\npatients with autoimmune disease, medical conditions requiring systemic\nimmunosuppression, ocular melanoma, active brain metastasis, or a history of Grade 4\nipilimumab-related adverse reactions (except for endocrinopathies) or Grade 3\nipilimumab-related adverse reactions that had not resolved or were inadequately\ncontrolled within 12 weeks of the initiating event. Tumor assessments were conducted 9\nweeks after randomization then every 6 weeks for the first year, and every 12 weeks\nthereafter.\nEfficacy was evaluated in a single-arm, non-comparative, planned interim analysis of the\nfirst 120 patients who received OPDIVO in CHECKMATE-037 and in whom the minimum\nduration of follow-up was 6 months. The major efficacy outcome measures in this\npopulation were confirmed overall response rate (ORR) as measured by blinded\nindependent central review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST\n1.1) and duration of response.\n2\n2\nAmong the 120 patients treated with OPDIVO, the median age was 58 years (range: 25\nto 88), 65% of patients were male, 98% were White, and the ECOG performance score\nwas 0 (58%) or 1 (42%). Disease characteristics were M1c disease (76%), BRAF V600\nmutation positive (22%), elevated LDH (56%), history of brain metastases (18%), and\ntwo or more prior systemic therapies for metastatic disease (68%).\nThe ORR was 32% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23, 41), consisting of 4 complete\nresponses and 34 partial responses in OPDIVO-treated patients. Of 38 patients with\nresponses, 87% had ongoing responses with durations ranging from 2.6+ to 10+\nmonths, which included 13 patients with ongoing responses of 6 months or longer.\nThere were responses in patients with and without BRAF V600 mutation-positive\nmelanoma. A total of 405 patients were randomized and the median duration of OS was\n15.7 months (95% CI: 12.9, 19.9) in OPDIVO-treated patients compared to 14.4 months\n(95% CI: 11.7, 18.2) (HR 0.95; 95.54% CI: 0.73, 1.24) in patients assigned to\ninvestigator\u2019s choice of treatment. Figure 1 summarizes the OS results.\nFigure 1: Overall Survival - CHECKMATE-037*\n*   The primary OS analysis was not adjusted to account for subsequent therapies, with\n54 (40.6%) patients in the chemotherapy arm subsequently receiving an anti-PD1\ntreatment. OS may be confounded by dropout, imbalance of subsequent therapies, and\ndifferences in baseline factors.\nPreviously Untreated Metastatic Melanoma\nCHECKMATE-066\nCHECKMATE-066 (NCT01721772) was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized (1:1) trial\nin 418 patients with BRAF V600 wild-type unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Patients\nwere randomized to receive either OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2\nweeks or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m  intravenously every 3 weeks until disease\nprogression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by PD-L1 status\n(\u22655% of tumor cell membrane staining by immunohistochemistry vs. <5% or\nindeterminate result) and M stage (M0/M1a/M1b versus M1c). Key eligibility criteria\nincluded histologically confirmed, unresectable or metastatic, cutaneous, mucosal, or\nacral melanoma; no prior therapy for metastatic disease; completion of prior adjuvant or\nneoadjuvant therapy at least 6 weeks prior to randomization; ECOG performance status\n0 or 1; absence of autoimmune disease; and absence of active brain or leptomeningeal\nmetastases. The trial excluded patients with ocular melanoma. Tumor assessments were\nconducted 9 weeks after randomization then every 6 weeks for the first year and then\nevery 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival\n(OS). Additional outcome measures included investigator-assessed progression-free\nsurvival (PFS) and ORR per RECIST v1.1.\nThe trial population characteristics were: median age was 65 years (range: 18 to 87),\n59% were male, and 99.5% were White. Disease characteristics were M1c stage disease\n(61%), cutaneous melanoma (74%), mucosal melanoma (11%), elevated LDH level\n(37%), PD-L1 \u22655% tumor cell membrane expression (35%), and history of brain\nmetastasis (4%). More patients in the OPDIVO arm had an ECOG performance status of\n0 (71% vs. 58%).\nCHECKMATE-066 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for the\nOPDIVO arm compared with the dacarbazine arm in an interim analysis based on 47% of\nthe total planned events for OS. At the time of analysis, 88% (63/72) of OPDIVO-treated\npatients had ongoing responses, which included 43 patients with ongoing response of 6\nmonths or longer.

Patients\nwere required to have completed adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment at least 6 weeks\nprior to randomization and have no prior treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody and no\nevidence of active brain metastasis, ocular melanoma, autoimmune disease, or medical\nconditions requiring systemic immunosuppression.\nPatients were randomized to receive:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nRandomization was stratified by PD-L1 expression (\u22655% vs. <5% tumor cell membrane\nexpression) as determined by a clinical trial assay, BRAF V600 mutation status, and M\nstage per the AJCC staging system (M0, M1a, M1b vs. M1c). Tumor assessments were\nconducted 12 weeks after randomization then every 6 weeks for the first year, and\nevery 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were investigator-\nassessed PFS per RECIST v1.1 and OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures were\nd\nOPDIVO 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses,\nfollowed by OPDIVO as a single agent at a dose of 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion\nevery 2 weeks (OPDIVO and ipilimumab arm),\nOPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks (OPDIVO arm), or\nIpilimumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by placebo\nevery 2 weeks (ipilimumab arm).\nconfirmed ORR and duration of response.\nThe trial population characteristics were: median age 61 years (range: 18 to 90); 65%\nmale; 97% White; ECOG performance score 0 (73%) or 1 (27%).

Patients were randomized (2:1) to\nreceive OPDIVO 480 mg or placebo by intravenous infusion every 4 weeks for up to 1\nyear or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Enrollment required complete\nf\nresection of the primary melanoma with negative margins and a negative sentinel lymph\nnode within 12 weeks prior to randomization, and ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.\nThe trial excluded patients with ocular/uveal or mucosal melanoma, autoimmune disease,\nany condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (\u226510 mg daily\nprednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications, as well as patients\nwith prior therapy for melanoma except surgery. Randomization was stratified by AJCC\n8\n staging system edition (T3b vs. T4a vs. T4b). The major efficacy outcome measure\nwas recurrence-free survival (RFS) defined as the time between the date of\nrandomization and the date of first recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis),\nnew primary melanoma, or death, from any cause, whichever occurred first and as\nassessed by the investigator. Tumor assessments were conducted every 26 weeks\nduring years 1-3 and every 52 weeks thereafter until year 5.\nThe trial population characteristics were: median age 62 years (range: 19 to 92), 61%\nwere male, 98% were White, 0.4% Black or African American, 0.1% Asian, and 1.1%\nrace unknown, 2.2% Hispanic or Latino, 58% Not Hispanic or Latino, 40% ethnicity\nunknown, and 94% had an ECOG performance status of 0.

The study included patients (18 years of\nage or older) with histologically confirmed Stage IV or recurrent NSCLC (per the 7th\nInternational Association for the Study of Lung Cancer [IASLC] classification), ECOG\nperformance status 0 or 1, and no prior anticancer therapy. Patients were enrolled\nregardless of their tumor PD-L1 status. Patients with known EGFR mutations or ALK\ntranslocations sensitive to available targeted inhibitor therapy, untreated brain\nmetastases, carcinomatous meningitis, active autoimmune disease, or medical\nconditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded from the study.\nPatients with treated brain metastases were eligible if neurologically returned to baseline\nat least 2 weeks prior to enrolment, and either off corticosteroids, or on a stable or\ndecreasing dose of <10 mg daily prednisone equivalents.\nPrimary efficacy results were based on Part 1a of the study, which was limited to\npatients with PD-L1 tumor expression \u22651%. Tumor specimens were evaluated\nprospectively using the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay at a central laboratory.\nRandomization was stratified by tumor histology (non-squamous versus squamous).\nThe evaluation of efficacy relied on the comparison between:\n\u2022\n\u2022\nChemotherapy regimens consisted of pemetrexed (500 mg/m ) and cisplatin (75\nmg/m ) or pemetrexed (500 mg/m ) and carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6) for non-squamous\nNSCLC or gemcitabine (1000 or 1250 mg/m ) and cisplatin (75 mg/m ) or gemcitabine\n(1000 mg/m ) and carboplatin (AUC 5) (gemcitabine was administered on Days 1 and 8\nof each cycle) for squamous NSCLC.\nStudy treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or for up to\n24 months. Treatment continued beyond disease progression if a patient was clinically\nstable and was considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Patients who\ndiscontinued combination therapy because of an adverse event attributed to ipilimumab\nwere permitted to continue OPDIVO as a single agent. Tumor assessments were\nperformed every 6 weeks from the first dose of study treatment for the first 12\nmonths, then every 12 weeks until disease progression or study treatment was\ndiscontinued. The primary efficacy outcome measure was OS.

OS in favorable risk patients\nreceiving OPDIVO and ipilimumab compared to sunitinib has a hazard ratio of 1.45 (95%\nCI: 0.75, 2.81). The efficacy of OPDIVO and ipilimumab in previously untreated renal cell\ncarcinoma with favorable-risk disease has not been established.\nCHECKMATE-9ER\nCHECKMATE-9ER (NCT03141177) was a randomized, open-label study of OPDIVO\ncombined with cabozantinib versus sunitinib in patients with previously untreated\nadvanced RCC. CHECKMATE-9ER excluded patients with autoimmune disease or other\nmedical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression. Patients were stratified by\nIMDC prognostic score (favorable vs. intermediate vs. poor), PD-L1 tumor expression\n(\u22651% vs. <1% or indeterminate), and region (US/Canada/Western Europe/Northern\nEurope vs. Rest of World).\nPatients were randomized to OPDIVO 240 mg intravenously every 2 weeks and\ncabozantinib 40 mg orally daily (n=323), or sunitinib 50 mg orally daily for the first 4\nweeks of a 6-week cycle (4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off) (n=328).\nTreatment continued until disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or unacceptable toxicity.\nTreatment beyond RECIST-defined disease progression was permitted if the patient was\nclinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Tumor\nassessments were performed at baseline, after randomization at Week 12, then every 6\nweeks until Week 60, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.\nThe trial population characteristics were: median age 61 years (range: 28 to 90) with\n38% \u226565 years of age and 10% \u226575 years of age. The majority of patients were male\n(74%) and White (82%) and 23% and 77% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70% to 80%\nand 90% to 100%, respectively. Patient distribution by IMDC risk categories was 22%\nfavorable, 58% intermediate, and 20% poor.\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was PFS (BICR assessed). Additional efficacy\noutcome measures were OS and ORR (BICR assessed). The trial demonstrated a\nstatistically significant improvement in PFS, OS, and ORR for patients randomized to\nOPDIVO and cabozantinib compared with sunitinib. Consistent results for PFS were\nobserved across pre-specified subgroups of IMDC risk categories and PD-L1 tumor\nexpression status.

Patients had to have a Karnofsky\nPerformance Score (KPS) \u226570% and patients were included regardless of their PD-L1\nstatus. The trial excluded patients with any history of or concurrent brain metastases,\nprior treatment with an mTOR inhibitor, active autoimmune disease, or medical\nconditions requiring systemic immunosuppression. Patients were stratified by region,\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) Risk Group and the number of prior\nanti-angiogenic therapies. Patients were randomized OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous\ninfusion every 2 weeks (n=410) or everolimus 10 mg orally daily (n=411). The first\ntumor assessments were conducted 8 weeks after randomization and continued every\n8 weeks thereafter for the first year and then every 12 weeks until progression or\ntreatment discontinuation, whichever occurred later. The major efficacy outcome\nmeasure was overall survival (OS).\nThe trial population characteristics were: median age was 62 years (range: 18 to 88)\nwith 40% \u226565 years of age and 9% \u226575 years of age. The majority of patients were\nmale (75%) and White (88%) and 34% and 66% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70%\nto 80% and 90% to 100%, respectively. The majority of patients (77%) were treated with\none prior anti-angiogenic therapy.

CHECKMATE-039 (NCT01592370) was an open-label, multicenter, dose\nescalation trial that included cHL. Both studies included patients regardless of their\ntumor PD-L1 status and excluded patients with ECOG performance status of 2 or\ngreater, autoimmune disease, symptomatic interstitial lung disease, hepatic\ntransaminases more than 3 times ULN, creatinine clearance <40 mL/min, prior allogeneic\nHSCT, or chest irradiation within 24 weeks. In addition, both studies required an adjusted\ndiffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of over 60% in patients with\nprior pulmonary toxicity.\nPatients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks until disease\nprogression, maximal clinical benefit, or unacceptable toxicity. A cycle consisted of one\ndose. Dose reduction was not permitted.\nEfficacy was evaluated by ORR as determined by an IRRC. Additional outcome measures\nincluded duration of response (DOR).\nEfficacy was evaluated in 95 patients in CHECKMATE-205 and CHECKMATE-039\ncombined who had failure of autologous HSCT and post-transplantation brentuximab\nvedotin. The median age was 37 years (range: 18 to 72). The majority were male (64%)\nand White (87%). Patients had received a median of 5 prior systemic regimens (range: 2\nto 15). They received a median of 27 doses of OPDIVO (range: 3 to 48), with a median\nduration of therapy of 14 months (range: 1 to 23 months).

The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease, medical\nconditions requiring immunosuppression, recurrent or metastatic carcinoma of the\nnasopharynx, squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary histology, salivary gland or\nnon-squamous histologies (e.g., mucosal melanoma), or untreated brain metastasis.\nPatients with treated brain metastases were eligible if neurologically stable. Patients were\nrandomized to receive OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks or\ninvestigator\u2019s choice of cetuximab (400 mg/m  initial dose intravenously followed by 250\nmg/m  weekly), or methotrexate (40 to 60 mg/m  intravenously weekly), or docetaxel\n(30 to 40 mg/m  intravenously weekly).\nRandomization was stratified by prior cetuximab treatment (yes/no). The first tumor\nassessments were conducted 9 weeks after randomization and continued every 6\nweeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measure was OS. Additional efficacy\noutcome measures were PFS and ORR.\nA total of 361 patients were randomized; 240 patients to the OPDIVO arm and 121\npatients to the investigator\u2019s choice arm (docetaxel: 45%; methotrexate: 43%; and\ncetuximab: 12%).

High risk of recurrence was defined as either 1) ypT2-ypT4a or ypN  for\npatients who received neoadjuvant cisplatin or 2) pT3-pT4a or pN  for patients who did\nnot receive neoadjuvant cisplatin and who also either were ineligible for or refused\nadjuvant cisplatin. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive OPDIVO 240 mg or placebo\nby intravenous infusion every 2 weeks until recurrence or until unacceptable toxicity for\na maximum treatment duration of 1 year. Patients were stratified by pathologic nodal\nstatus (N+ vs. N0/x with <10 nodes removed vs. N0 with \u226510 nodes removed), tumor\ncells expressing PD-L1 (\u22651% vs. <1%/indeterminate as determined by the central lab\nusing the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay), and use of neoadjuvant cisplatin (yes vs.\nno).\nThe trial population characteristics were: median age of 67 years (range: 30 to 92); 76%\nmale; 76% White, 22% Asian, 0.7% Black, and 0.1% American Indian or Alaska Native.\nOf the 335 (47%) of patients with node-positive UC, 44 (6%) had non\u2013muscle-invasive\n(<pT2) primary tumors. ECOG performance status was 0 (63%), 1 (35%), or 2 (2%).\nPrior neoadjuvant cisplatin had been given to 43% of patients; of the 57% who did not\nreceive prior neoadjuvant cisplatin, reasons listed were ineligibility (22%), patient\npreference (33%), and other/not reported (2%). Tumor PD-L1 expression was \u22651% in\n40% of patients, and 21% of patients had upper tract UC.\nThe major efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed DFS in all randomized\npatients and in patients with tumors expressing PD-L1 \u22651%. DFS was defined as time to\nfirst recurrence (local urothelial tract, local non-urothelial tract, or distant metastasis), or\ndeath. Additional efficacy outcome measures included OS.\nAt the pre-specified interim analysis, CHECKMATE-274 demonstrated a statistically\nsignificant improvement in DFS for patients randomized to OPDIVO vs. placebo in the all\nrandomized patient population, as well as in the subpopulation of patients with PD-L1\n\u22651%, as shown in Table 68 and Figure 19.\nIn exploratory subgroup analyses in patients with upper tract UC (n=149), no\nimprovement in DFS was observed in the nivolumab arm compared to the placebo arm.\nThe unstratified DFS hazard ratio estimate was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.80).\nIn an exploratory subgroup analysis in patients with PD-L1 expression of <1% (n=414),\nthe unstratified DFS hazard ratio estimate was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.08).\nOS data is immature with 33% of deaths in the overall randomized population.

Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous\ninfusion every 2 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or either radiographic or clinical\nprogression. Tumor response assessments were conducted every 8 weeks for the first\n48 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter. Major efficacy outcome measures included\nconfirmed ORR as assessed by IRRC using RECIST v1.1 and DOR.\nThe median age was 66 years (range: 38 to 90), 78% were male, 86% were White.\nTwenty-seven percent had non-bladder urothelial carcinoma and 84% had visceral\nmetastases. Thirty-four percent of patients had disease progression following prior\nplatinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Twenty-nine percent of patients\nhad received \u22652 prior systemic regimens in the metastatic setting. Thirty-six percent of\npatients received prior cisplatin only, 23% received prior carboplatin only, and 7% were\ntreated with both cisplatin and carboplatin in the metastatic setting. Forty-six percent of\npatients had an ECOG performance status of 1. Eighteen percent of patients had a\nhemoglobin <10 g/dL, and twenty-eight percent of patients had liver metastases at\nbaseline. Patients were included regardless of their PD-L1 status.\nTumor specimens were evaluated prospectively using the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx\nassay at a central laboratory and the results were used to define subgroups for pre-\nspecified analyses. Of the 270 patients, 46% were defined as having PD-L1 expression\nof \u22651% (defined as \u22651% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1). The remaining 54% of\npatients were classified as having PD-L1 expression of <1% (defined as <1% of tumor\ncells expressing PD-L1). Confirmed ORR in all patients and the two PD-L1 subgroups are\nshown in Table 70. Median time to response was 1.9 months (range: 1.6-7.2). In 77\npatients who received prior systemic therapy only in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant\nsetting, the ORR was 23.4% (95% CI: 14.5%, 34.4%).\nTable 70: Efficacy Results - CHECKMATE-275\n Estimated from the Kaplan-Meier Curve\n Not Reached\nAll Patients\nN=270\nPD-L1 <1%\nN=146\nPD-L1 \u22651%\nN=124\nConfirmed Overall Response Rate,\nn (%) \n      (95% CI)\n53 (19.6%)\n(15.1, 24.9)\n22 (15.1%)\n(9.7, 21.9)\n31 (25.0%)\n(17.7, 33.6)\n   Complete response rate\n7 (2.6%)\n1 (0.7%)\n6 (4.8%)\n   Partial response rate\n46 (17.0%)\n21 (14.4%)\n25 (20.2%)\nMedian Duration of Response\n(months) (range)\n10.3 (1.9+,\n12.0+)\n7.6 (3.7, 12.0+)\nNR  (1.9+,\n12.0+)\n14.10 Microsatellite Instability-High or Mismatch Repair Deficient Metastatic\nColorectal Cancer\nCHECKMATE-142 (NCT02060188) was a multicenter, non-randomized, multiple parallel-\ncohort, open-label trial conducted in patients with locally determined dMMR or MSI-H\nmetastatic CRC (mCRC) who had disease progression during or after prior treatment\nwith fluoropyrimidine- , oxaliplatin- , or irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Key eligibility\ncriteria were at least one prior line of treatment for metastatic disease, ECOG\nperformance status 0 or 1, and absence of the following: active brain metastases, active\nautoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression.\nPatients enrolled in the single agent OPDIVO MSI-H mCRC cohort received OPDIVO 3\nmg/kg by intravenous infusion (IV) every 2 weeks. Patients enrolled in the OPDIVO and\nipilimumab MSI-H mCRC cohort received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg\nintravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by OPDIVO as a single agent at a\ndose of 3 mg/kg as intravenous infusion every 2 weeks. Treatment in both cohorts\ncontinued until unacceptable toxicity or radiographic progression.\nTumor assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and every 12\nweeks thereafter. Efficacy outcome measures included ORR and DOR as assessed by\nBICR using RECIST v1.1.\nA total of 74 patients were enrolled in the single-agent MSI-H mCRC OPDIVO cohort. The\nmedian age was 53 years (range: 26 to 79) with 23% \u226565 years of age and 5% \u226575\nyears of age, 59% were male and 88% were White. Baseline ECOG performance status\nwas 0 (43%), 1 (55%), or 3 (1.4%) and 36% were reported to have Lynch Syndrome.\nAcross the 74 patients, 72% received prior treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin,\nand irinotecan; 7%, 30%, 28%, 19%, and 16% received 0, 1, 2, 3, or \u22654 prior lines of\ntherapy for metastatic disease, respectively, and 42% of patients had received an anti-\nEGFR antibody.\nA total of 119 patients were enrolled in the OPDIVO and ipilimumab MSI-H mCRC cohort.\nThe median age was 58 years (range: 21 to 88), with 32% \u226565 years of age and 9%\n\u226575 years of age; 59% were male and 92% were White.

Additional eligibility criteria included histologic confirmation of HCC and Child-\nPugh Class A cirrhosis. The trial excluded patients with active autoimmune disease, brain\nmetastasis, a history of hepatic encephalopathy, clinically significant ascites, infection\nwith HIV, or active co-infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) or\nHBV and hepatitis D virus (HDV); however, patients with only active HBV or HCV were\na\nb\nc\na\nb\nc\neligible.\nTumor assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for 48 weeks and then every 12\nweeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measure was confirmed overall response\nrate as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1 and modified RECIST (mRECIST) for HCC.\nDuration of response was also assessed.\nThe efficacy of OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab was evaluated in 49 patients\n(Cohort 4) who received OPDIVO 1 mg/kg and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg administered every 3\nweeks for 4 doses, followed by single-agent OPDIVO at 240 mg every 2 weeks until\ndisease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median age was 60 years (range: 18\nto 80), 88% were male, 74% were Asian, and 25% were White. Baseline ECOG\nperformance status was 0 (61%) or 1 (39%). Fifty-seven (57%) percent of patients had\nactive HBV infection, 8% had active HCV infection, and 35% had no evidence of active\nHBV or HCV. The etiology for HCC was alcoholic liver disease in 16% and non-alcoholic\nfatty liver disease in 6% of patients. Child-Pugh class and score was A5 for 82% and A6\nfor 18%; 80% of patients had extrahepatic spread; 35% had vascular invasion; and 51%\nhad AFP levels \u2265400 \u00b5g/L. Prior cancer treatment history included surgery (74%),\nradiotherapy (29%), or local treatment (59%). All patients had received prior sorafenib,\nof whom 10% were unable to tolerate sorafenib; 29% of patients had received 2 or more\nprior systemic therapies.\nEfficacy results are shown in Table 72.

Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either\nOPDIVO 240 mg or placebo by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks for\n16 weeks followed by 480 mg or placebo by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every\n4 weeks beginning at week 17. Treatment was until disease recurrence, unacceptable\ntoxicity, or for up to 1 year in total duration. Enrollment required complete resection\nwithin 4 to 16 weeks prior to randomization. The trial excluded patients who did not\nreceive CRT prior to surgery, had stage IV resectable disease, autoimmune disease, or\nany condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (>10 mg daily\nprednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications. Randomization was\nstratified by tumor PD-L1 status (\u22651% vs. <1% or indeterminate or non-evaluable),\npathologic lymph node status (positive \u2265ypN1 vs. negative ypN0), and histology\n(squamous vs. adenocarcinoma). The major efficacy outcome measure was disease-free\nsurvival (DFS) defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of\nfirst recurrence (local, regional, or distant from the primary resected site) or death, from\nany cause, whichever occurred first as assessed by the investigator prior to subsequent\nanti-cancer therapy. Patients on treatment underwent imaging for tumor recurrence\nevery 12 weeks for 2 years, and a minimum of one scan every 6 to 12 months for years\n3 to 5.\nThe trial population characteristics were: median age 62 years (range: 26 to 86), 36%\nwere \u226565 years of age, 85% were male, 15% were Asian, 82% were White, and 1.1%\nwere Black. Disease characteristics were AJCC Stage II (35%) or Stage III (65%) at initial\ndiagnosis carcinoma, EC (60%) or GEJC (40%) at initial diagnosis, with pathologic positive\nlymph node status (58%) at study entry and histological confirmation of predominant\nadenocarcinoma (71%) or squamous cell carcinoma (29%). The baseline Tumor PD-L1\nstatus \u22651% was positive for 16% of patients and negative for 72% of patients. Baseline\nECOG performance status was 0 (58%) or 1 (42%).\nCHECKMATE-577 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in DFS for patients\nrandomized to the OPDIVO arm as compared with the placebo arm. DFS benefit was\nobserved regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression and histology.\nEfficacy results are shown in Table 73 and Figure 22.\nTable 73: Efficacy Results - CHECKMATE-577\nOPDIVO\n(n=532)\nPlacebo\n(n=262)\nDisease-free Survival\n     Number of events, n (%)\n241 (45%)\n155 (59%)\n     Median (months)\n22.4\n11.0\na\nb\n Based on a stratified proportional hazards model.\n Based on a stratified log-rank test.\n          (95% CI)\n(16.6, 34.0)\n(8.3, 14.3)\n     Hazard ratio  (95% CI)\n0.69 (0.56, 0.85)\n     p-value\n0.0003\nFigure 22: Disease-free Survival - CHECKMATE-577\nFirst-line Treatment of Unresectable Advanced or Metastatic ESCC\nCHECKMATE-648 (NCT03143153) was a randomized, active-controlled, open-label trial in\npatients with previously untreated unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic ESCC\n(squamous or adenosquamous histology). The trial enrolled patients whose tumor was\nevaluable for tumor cell (TC) PD-L1 expression [also called PD-L1 tumor proportion\nscore (TPS)], which was evaluated using the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay at a central\nlaboratory. A retrospective scoring of a patient\u2019s tumor PD-L1 status using Combined\nPositive Score (CPS), was also conducted using the PD-L1-stained tumor specimens\nused for randomization. Patients were not amenable to chemoradiation or surgery with\ncurative intent. Prior treatment with curative intent was allowed if completed more than\nsix months prior to trial enrollment. The trial excluded patients with brain metastasis that\nwere symptomatic, had active autoimmune disease, used systemic corticosteroids or\nimmunosuppressants, or patients at high risk of bleeding or fistula due to apparent\ninvasion of tumor to organs adjacent to the esophageal tumor. Patients were\nrandomized to receive one of the following treatments:\n\u2022\n\u2022\na\nb\na\nb\nOPDIVO 240 mg on days 1 and 15, fluorouracil 800 mg/m /day intravenously on\ndays 1 through 5 (for 5 days), and cisplatin 80 mg/m  intravenously on day 1 (of a\n4-week cycle).\n2\n2\nOPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6\n\u2022\nPatients received OPDIVO until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 2\nyears. In patients who received OPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy and in whom\neither fluorouracil and/or cisplatin were discontinued, other components of the\ntreatment regimen were allowed to be continued. Patients who discontinued combination\ntherapy because of an adverse reaction attributed to ipilimumab were permitted to\ncontinue OPDIVO as a single agent.\nRandomization was stratified by TC PD-L1 expression (\u22651% vs. <1% or indeterminate),\nregion (East Asia vs. Rest of Asia vs. Rest of World), ECOG performance status (0 vs.\n1), and number of organs with metastases (\u22641 vs. \u22652). The major efficacy outcome\nmeasures were OS and BICR-assessed PFS in patients with TC PD-L1 expression \u2265 1%.\nAdditional efficacy measures included OS in all randomized patients, BICR-assessed PFS\nin all randomized patients, and ORR assessed by BICR in TC PD-L1 expression \u2265 1% and\nin all randomized patients. The tumor assessments per RECIST v1.1 were conducted\nevery 6 weeks up to and including week 48, then every 12 weeks thereafter.\nA total of 970 patients were randomized in CHECKMATE-648 study among whom 965\nand 906 patients had quantifiable TC PD-L1 expression and CPS at baseline, respectively.\nThe trial population characteristics for all randomized patients were median age 64 years\n(range: 26 to 90), 47% were \u226565 years of age, 82.% were male, 71% were Asian, 26%\nwere White, and 1.1% were Black.

A total of 27 patients in the OPDIVO with chemotherapy arm, 31 patients\nin the OPDIVO with Ipilimumab arm, and 24 patients in the chemotherapy arm had PD-\nL1 CPS<1.\nOS results for each comparison by PD-L1 CPS status were:\n\u2022\n\u2022\nPreviously Treated Unresectable Advanced, Recurrent or Metastatic Esophageal\nSquamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC)\nOPDIVO with Chemotherapy (n=163) vs. Chemotherapy (n=165): unstratified OS\nHR was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.29) with median OS of 12 months (95% CI: 9.9, 15.5)\non the OPDIVO with Chemotherapy arm and 12.2 months (95% CI: 10.7, 14) on\nthe Chemotherapy arm\nOPDIVO with Ipilimumab (n=164) vs. Chemotherapy (n=165): unstratified OS HR\nwas 0.97 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.26) with median OS of 12 months (95% CI: 10.1, 16.0)\non the OPDIVO with Ipilimumab arm and 12.2 months (95% CI: 10.7, 14) on the\nChemotherapy arm\nOPDIVO with Chemotherapy vs. Chemotherapy: unstratified OS HR was 0.69 (95%\nCI: 0.56, 0.84) for PD-L1 CPS\u22651 subgroup and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.95) for PD-L1\nCPS<1 subgroup.\nOPDIVO with Ipilimumab vs. Chemotherapy: unstratified OS HR was 0.76 (95% CI:\n0.62, 0.93) for PD-L1 CPS\u22651 subgroup and 1.0 (95% CI: 0.52, 1.94) for PD-L1\nCPS<1 subgroup.\nATTRACTION-3 (NCT02569242) was a multicenter, randomized (1:1), active-controlled,\nopen-label trial in patients with unresectable advanced, recurrent, or metastatic ESCC,\nwho were refractory or intolerant to at least one fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based\nregimen. The trial enrolled patients regardless of PD-L1 status, but tumor specimens\nwere evaluated prospectively using the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay at a central\nlaboratory. The trial excluded patients who were refractory or intolerant to taxane\ntherapy, had brain metastases that were symptomatic or required treatment, had\nautoimmune disease, used systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, or had\napparent tumor invasion of organs adjacent to the esophageal tumor or had stents in\nthe esophagus or respiratory tract. Patients were randomized to receive OPDIVO 240\nmg by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks or investigator\u2019s choice of\ntaxane chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel (75 mg/m  intravenously every 3 weeks)\nor paclitaxel (100 mg/m  intravenously once a week for 6 weeks followed by 1 week off).\nRandomization was stratified by region (Japan vs. Rest of World), number of organs\nwith metastases (\u22641 vs. \u22652), and PD-L1 status (\u22651% vs. <1% or indeterminate).\nPatients were treated until disease progression, assessed by the investigator per RECIST\nv1.1, or unacceptable toxicity. The tumor assessments were conducted every 6 weeks\nfor 1 year, and every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measure was\nOS. Additional efficacy outcome measures were ORR and PFS as assessed by the\ninvestigator using RECIST v1.1 and DOR.\nA total of 419 patients were randomized; 210 to the OPDIVO arm and 209 to the\ninvestigator\u2019s choice arm (docetaxel: 31%, paclitaxel: 69%). The trial population\ncharacteristics were: median age 65 years (range: 33 to 87), 53% were \u226565 years of\nage, 87% were male, 96% were Asian and 4% were White. Sixty-seven percent of\npatients had received one prior systemic therapy regimen and 26% had received two\nprior systemic therapy regimens prior to enrolling in ATTRACTION-3. Baseline ECOG\nperformance status was 0 (50%) or 1 (50%).\nATTRACTION-3 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients\nrandomized to OPDIVO as compared with investigator\u2019s choice of taxane\nchemotherapy. OS benefit was observed regardless of PD-L1 expression level. The\nminimum follow-up was 17.6 months.

There is no recommended dose for patients\nwhose creatinine clearance is less than 45 mL/min [see Use in Specific Populations\n(8.6)].\n2.4 Premedication and Concomitant Medications to Mitigate Toxicity\nVitamin Supplementation\nInitiate folic acid 400 mcg to 1000 mcg orally once daily, beginning 7 days before the\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nfirst dose of ALIMTA and continuing until 21 days after the last dose of ALIMTA [see\nWarnings and Precautions (5.1)].\nAdminister vitamin B\n, 1 mg intramuscularly, 1 week prior to the first dose of\nALIMTA and every 3 cycles thereafter. Subsequent vitamin B\n injections may be\ngiven the same day as treatment with ALIMTA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\nDo not substitute oral vitamin B\nfor intramuscular vitamin B\n.\nCorticosteroids\nAdminister dexamethasone 4 mg orally twice daily for three consecutive days,\nbeginning the day before each ALIMTA administration.\n2.5 Dosage Modification of Ibuprofen in Patients with Mild to Moderate Renal\nImpairment Receiving ALIMTA\nIn patients with creatinine clearances between 45 mL/min and 79 mL/min, modify\nadministration of ibuprofen as follows [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Drug\nInteractions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\nAvoid administration of ibuprofen for 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following\nadministration of ALIMTA.\nMonitor patients more frequently for myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal\ntoxicity, if concomitant administration of ibuprofen cannot be avoided.\n2.6 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions\nObtain complete blood count on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. Assess creatinine\nclearance prior to each cycle. Do not administer ALIMTA if the creatinine clearance is less\nthan 45 mL/min.\nDelay initiation of the next cycle of ALIMTA until:\nrecovery of non-hematologic toxicity to Grade 0-2,\nabsolute neutrophil count (ANC) is 1500 cells/mm  or higher, and\nplatelet count is 100,000 cells/mm  or higher.\nUpon recovery, modify the dosage of ALIMTA in the next cycle as specified in Table 1.\nFor dosing modifications for cisplatin, carboplatin, or pembrolizumab, refer to their\nprescribing information.\nTable 1: Recommended Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions\nToxicity in Most Recent Treatment Cycle\nALIMTA Dose\nModification for Next\nCycle\nMyelosuppressive toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n     ANC less than 500/mm and platelets greater than or\nequal to 50,000/mm  \n     OR \n     Platelet count less than 50,000/mm  without bleeding.\n75% of previous dose\n     Platelet count less than 50,000/mm  with bleeding\n50% of previous dose\n     Recurrent Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression after 2 dose\nreductions\nDiscontinue\n12\n12\n12 \n12\n3\n3\na\n3 \n3\n3\n3\n National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 2 (NCI CTCAE v2).\nNon-hematologic toxicity\n     Any Grade 3 or 4 toxicities EXCEPT mucositis or\nneurologic toxicity\n     OR \n     Diarrhea requiring hospitalization\n75% of previous dose\n     Grade 3 or 4 mucositis\n50% of previous dose\n     Renal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nWithhold until creatinine\nclearance is 45 mL/min or\ngreater\n     Grade 3 or 4 neurologic toxicity\nPermanently discontinue\n     Recurrent Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity after 2\ndose reductions\nPermanently discontinue\n     Severe and life-threatening Skin Toxicity [see Warnings and\nPrecautions (5.3)]\nPermanently discontinue\n     Interstitial Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions\n(5.4)]\nPermanently discontinue\n2.7 Preparation for Administration\nALIMTA is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal\nprocedures.\nCalculate the dose of ALIMTA and determine the number of vials needed.\nReconstitute ALIMTA to achieve a concentration of 25 mg/mL as follows:\nReconstitute each 100-mg vial with 4.2 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP\n(preservative-free)\nReconstitute each 500-mg vial with 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP\n(preservative-free)\nDo not use calcium-containing solutions for reconstitution.\nGently swirl each vial until the powder is completely dissolved. The resulting solution is\nclear and ranges in color from colorless to yellow or green-yellow. FURTHER\nDILUTION IS REQUIRED prior to administration.\nStore reconstituted, preservative-free product under refrigerated conditions [2-8\u00b0C\n(36-46\u00b0F)] for no longer than 24 hours from the time of reconstitution. Discard vial\nafter 24 hours.\nInspect reconstituted product visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to\nfurther dilution. If particulate matter is observed, discard vial.\nWithdraw the calculated dose of ALIMTA from the vial(s) and discard vial with any\nunused portion.\nFurther dilute ALIMTA with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (preservative-free) to\nachieve a total volume of 100 mL for intravenous infusion.\nStore diluted, reconstituted product under refrigerated conditions [2-8\u00b0C (36-46\u00b0F)]\nfor no more than 24 hours from the time of reconstitution. Discard after 24 hours.\n3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nFor injection: 100 mg or 500 mg pemetrexed as a white to light-yellow or green-yellow\nlyophilized powder in single-dose vials for reconstitution.\na\n1\n4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nALIMTA is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to\npemetrexed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n5.1 Myelosuppression and Increased Risk of Myelosuppression without\nVitamin Supplementation\nALIMTA can cause severe myelosuppression resulting in a requirement for transfusions\nand which may lead to neutropenic infection. The risk of myelosuppression is increased\nin patients who do not receive vitamin supplementation. In Study JMCH, incidences of\nGrade 3-4 neutropenia (38% versus 23%), thrombocytopenia (9% versus 5%), febrile\nneutropenia (9% versus 0.6%), and neutropenic infection (6% versus 0) were higher in\npatients who received ALIMTA plus cisplatin without vitamin supplementation as\ncompared to patients who were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B\n prior\nto and throughout ALIMTA plus cisplatin treatment.\nInitiate supplementation with oral folic acid and intramuscular vitamin B\n prior to the\nfirst dose of ALIMTA; continue vitamin supplementation during treatment and for 21\ndays after the last dose of ALIMTA to reduce the severity of hematologic and\ngastrointestinal toxicity of ALIMTA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Obtain a\ncomplete blood count at the beginning of each cycle. Do not administer ALIMTA until the\nANC is at least 1500 cells/mm  and platelet count is at least 100,000 cells/mm .\nPermanently reduce ALIMTA in patients with an ANC of less than 500 cells/mm  or\nplatelet count of less than 50,000 cells/mm  in previous cycles [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.6)].\nIn Studies JMDB and JMCH, among patients who received vitamin supplementation,\nincidence of Grade 3-4 neutropenia was 15% and 23%, the incidence of Grade 3-4\nanemia was 6% and 4%, and incidence of Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia was 4% and 5%,\nrespectively. In Study JMCH, 18% of patients in the ALIMTA arm required red blood cell\ntransfusions compared to 7% of patients in the cisplatin arm [see Adverse Reactions\n(6.1)]. In Studies JMEN, PARAMOUNT, and JMEI, where all patients received vitamin\nsupplementation, incidence of Grade 3-4 neutropenia ranged from 3% to 5%, and\nincidence of Grade 3-4 anemia ranged from 3% to 5%.\n5.2 Renal Failure\nALIMTA can cause severe, and sometimes fatal, renal toxicity. The incidences of renal\nfailure in clinical studies in which patients received ALIMTA with cisplatin were: 2.1% in\nStudy JMDB and 2.2% in Study JMCH. The incidence of renal failure in clinical studies in\nwhich patients received ALIMTA as a single agent ranged from 0.4% to 0.6% (Studies\nJMEN, PARAMOUNT, and JMEI [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Determine creatinine\nclearance before each dose and periodically monitor renal function during treatment with\nALIMTA. Withhold ALIMTA in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 45\nmL/minute [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.3 Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Toxicity\n12\n12\n3\n3\n3\n3\nSerious and sometimes fatal, bullous, blistering and exfoliative skin toxicity, including\ncases suggestive of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic epidermal necrolysis can occur\nwith ALIMTA. Permanently discontinue ALIMTA for severe and life-threatening bullous,\nblistering or exfoliating skin toxicity.\n5.4 Interstitial Pneumonitis\nSerious interstitial pneumonitis, including fatal cases, can occur with ALIMTA treatment.\nWithhold ALIMTA for acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary\nsymptoms such as dyspnea, cough, or fever pending diagnostic evaluation. If\npneumonitis is confirmed, permanently discontinue ALIMTA.\n5.5 Radiation Recall\nRadiation recall can occur with ALIMTA in patients who have received radiation weeks to\nyears previously. Monitor patients for inflammation or blistering in areas of previous\nradiation treatment. Permanently discontinue ALIMTA for signs of radiation recall.\n5.6 Increased Risk of Toxicity with Ibuprofen in Patients with Renal\nImpairment\nExposure to ALIMTA is increased in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment who\ntake concomitant ibuprofen, increasing the risks of adverse reactions of ALIMTA. In\npatients with creatinine clearances between 45 mL/min and 79 mL/min, avoid\nadministration of ibuprofen for 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following\nadministration of ALIMTA. If concomitant ibuprofen use cannot be avoided, monitor\npatients more frequently for ALIMTA adverse reactions, including myelosuppression,\nrenal, and gastrointestinal toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Drug\nInteractions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, ALIMTA can cause\nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies,\nintravenous administration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice during the period of\norganogenesis was teratogenic, resulting in developmental delays and increased\nmalformations at doses lower than the recommended human dose of 500 mg/m .\nAdvise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive\npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALIMTA and for 6 months\nafter the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use\neffective contraception during treatment with ALIMTA and for 3 months after the last\ndose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the\nlabeling:\nMyelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nRenal failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nBullous and exfoliative skin toxicity [see Warning and Precautions (5.3)]\nInterstitial pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]\n2\nRadiation recall [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions\nrates cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the\nrates observed in clinical practice.\nIn clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226520%) of ALIMTA, when\nadministered as a single agent, are fatigue, nausea, and anorexia. The most common\nadverse reactions (incidence \u226520%) of ALIMTA, when administered in combination with\ncisplatin are vomiting, neutropenia, anemia, stomatitis/pharyngitis, thrombocytopenia,\nand constipation. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226520%) of ALIMTA,\nwhen administered in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy, are\nfatigue/asthenia, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, decreased appetite, rash, vomiting,\ncough, dyspnea, and pyrexia.\nNon-Squamous NSCLC\nFirst-line Treatment of Metastatic Non-squamous NSCLC with Pembrolizumab and\nPlatinum Chemotherapy\nThe safety of ALIMTA, in combination with pembrolizumab and investigator's choice of\nplatinum (either carboplatin or cisplatin), was investigated in Study KEYNOTE-189, a\nmulticenter, double-blind, randomized (2:1), active-controlled trial in patients with\npreviously untreated, metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic\ntumor aberrations. A total of 607 patients received ALIMTA, pembrolizumab, and\nplatinum every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by ALIMTA and pembrolizumab (n=405), or\nplacebo, ALIMTA, and platinum every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by placebo and\nALIMTA (n=202). Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy\nwithin 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or\nwho had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were\nineligible [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].\nThe median duration of exposure to ALIMTA was 7.2 months (range: 1 day to 1.7\nyears). Seventy-two percent of patients received carboplatin. The study population\ncharacteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 34 to 84), 49% age 65 years or\nolder, 59% male, 94% White and 3% Asian, and 18% with history of brain metastases at\nbaseline.\nALIMTA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 23% of patients in the ALIMTA,\npembrolizumab, and platinum arm. The most common adverse reactions resulting in\ndiscontinuation of ALIMTA in this arm were acute kidney injury (3%) and pneumonitis\n(2%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of ALIMTA occurred in 49% of patients in\nthe ALIMTA, pembrolizumab, and platinum arm. The most common adverse reactions or\nlaboratory abnormalities leading to interruption of ALIMTA in this arm (\u22652%) were\nneutropenia (12%), anemia (7%), asthenia (4%), pneumonia (4%), thrombocytopenia\n(4%), increased blood creatinine (3%), diarrhea (3%), and fatigue (3%).\nTable 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in \u226520% of patients treated\nwith ALIMTA, pembrolizumab, and platinum.\nTable 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u226520% of Patients in KEYNOTE-189\n Graded per NCI CTCAE version 4.03.\n Includes asthenia and fatigue.\n Includes genital rash, rash, rash generalized, rash macular, rash maculo-papular, rash papular, rash\npruritic, and rash pustular.\nALIMTA \nPembrolizumab \nPlatinum Chemotherapy\nn=405\nPlacebo \nALIMTA \nPlatinum\nChemotherapy \nn=202\nAdverse Reaction\nAll Grades  \n(%)\nGrade 3-4 \n(%)\nAll Grades \n(%)\nGrade 3-4 \n(%)\nGastrointestinal Disorders\n     Nausea\n56\n3.5\n52\n3.5\n     Constipation\n35\n1.0\n32\n0.5\n     Diarrhea\n31\n5\n21\n3.0\n     Vomiting\n24\n3.7\n23\n3.0\nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions\n     Fatigue\n56\n12\n58\n6\n     Pyrexia\n20\n0.2\n15\n0\nMetabolism and Nutrition Disorders\n     Decreased appetite\n28\n1.5\n30\n0.5\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders\n     Rash\n25\n2.0\n17\n2.5\nRespiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders\n     Cough\n21\n0\n28\n0\n     Dyspnea\n21\n3.7\n26\n5\nTable 3 summarizes the laboratory abnormalities that worsened from baseline in at least\n20% of patients treated with ALIMTA, pembrolizumab, and platinum.\nTable 3: Laboratory Abnormalities Worsened from Baseline in \u226520% of\nPatients in KEYNOTE-189\nALIMTA \nPembrolizumab \nPlatinum\nChemotherapy\nPlacebo \nALIMTA \nPlatinum\nChemotherapy\nLaboratory Test\nAll Grades  \n%\nGrades 3-\n4 \n%\nAll Grades \n%\nGrades 3-\n4 \n%\nChemistry\n     Hyperglycemia\n63\n9\n60\n7\n     Increased ALT\n47\n3.8\n42\n2.6\n     Increased AST\n47\n2.8\n40\n1.0\n     Hypoalbuminemia\n39\n2.8\n39\n1.1\n     Increased creatinine\n37\n4.2\n25\n1.0\n     Hyponatremia\n32\n7\n23\n6\na\nb\nc\na\nb\nc\na\nb\n Each test incidence is based on the number of patients who had both baseline and at least one\non-study laboratory measurement available: ALIMTA/pembrolizumab/platinum chemotherapy\n(range: 381 to 401 patients) and placebo/ALIMTA/platinum chemotherapy (range: 184 to\n197 patients).\n Graded per NCI CTCAE version 4.03.\n     Hypophosphatemia\n30\n10\n28\n14\n     Increased alkaline phosphatase\n26\n1.8\n29\n2.1\n     Hypocalcemia\n24\n2.8\n17\n0.5\n     Hyperkalemia\n24\n2.8\n19\n3.1\n     Hypokalemia\n21\n5\n20\n5\nHematology\n     Anemia\n85\n17\n81\n18\n     Lymphopenia\n64\n22\n64\n25\n     Neutropenia\n48\n20\n41\n19\n     Thrombocytopenia\n30\n12\n29\n8\nInitial Treatment in Combination with Cisplatin\nThe safety of ALIMTA was evaluated in Study JMDB, a randomized (1:1), open-label,\nmulticenter trial conducted in chemotherapy-naive patients with locally advanced or\nmetastatic NSCLC. Patients received either ALIMTA 500 mg/m  intravenously and\ncisplatin 75 mg/m  intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle (n=839) or gemcitabine\n1250 mg/m  intravenously on Days 1 and 8 and cisplatin 75 mg/m  intravenously on\nDay 1 of each 21-day cycle (n=830). All patients were fully supplemented with folic acid\nand vitamin B\n.\nStudy JMDB excluded patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group\nPerformance Status (ECOG PS of 2 or greater), uncontrolled third-space fluid retention,\ninadequate bone marrow reserve and organ function, or a calculated creatinine\nclearance less than 45 mL/min. Patients unable to stop using aspirin or other non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or unable to take folic acid, vitamin B\n or\ncorticosteroids were also excluded from the study.\nThe data described below reflect exposure to ALIMTA plus cisplatin in 839 patients in\nStudy JMDB. Median age was 61 years (range 26-83 years); 70% of patients were men;\n78% were White, 16% were Asian, 2.9% were Hispanic or Latino, 2.1% were Black or\nAfrican American, and <1% were other ethnicities; 36% had an ECOG PS 0. Patients\nreceived a median of 5 cycles of ALIMTA.\nTable 4 provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions that occurred in \u22655%\nof 839 patients receiving ALIMTA in combination with cisplatin in Study JMDB.

In animal reproduction\nstudies, intravenous administration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice during the period of\norganogenesis was teratogenic, resulting in developmental delays and malformations at\ndoses lower than the recommended human dose of 500 mg/m [see Data]. Advise\npregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus [see Use in Special Populations (8.3)].\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nPemetrexed was teratogenic in mice. Daily dosing of pemetrexed by intravenous\ninjection to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis increased the incidence of\nfetal malformations (cleft palate; protruding tongue; enlarged or misshaped kidney; and\nfused lumbar vertebra) at doses (based on BSA) 0.03 times the human dose of\n500 mg/m . At doses, based on BSA, greater than or equal to 0.0012 times the\n500 mg/m  human dose, pemetrexed administration resulted in dose-dependent\nincreases in developmental delays (incomplete ossification of talus and skull bone; and\ndecreased fetal weight).\n8.2 Lactation\nBlood and Lymphatic System \u2014 immune-mediated hemolytic anemia\nGastrointestinal \u2014 colitis, pancreatitis\nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions \u2014 edema\nInjury, poisoning, and procedural complications \u2014 radiation recall\nRespiratory \u2014 interstitial pneumonitis\nSkin \u2014 Serious and fatal bullous skin conditions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and\ntoxic epidermal necrolysis\n2 \n2\n2\nRisk Summary\nThere is no information regarding the presence of pemetrexed or its metabolites in\nhuman milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production.\nBecause of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from ALIMTA,\nadvise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ALIMTA and for one week after\nthe last dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nBased on animal data ALIMTA can cause malformations and developmental delays when\nadministered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating\nPemetrexed Injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nContraception\nFemales\nBecause of the potential for genotoxicity, advise females of reproductive potential to use\neffective contraception during treatment with ALIMTA and for 6 months after the last\ndose.\nMales\nBecause of the potential for genotoxicity, advise males with female partners of\nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALIMTA and\nfor 3 months after the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\nInfertility\nMales\nALIMTA may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether\nthese effects on fertility are reversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of ALIMTA in pediatric patients have not been established.\nThe safety and pharmacokinetics of ALIMTA were evaluated in two clinical studies\nconducted in pediatric patients with recurrent solid tumors (NCT00070473 N=32 and\nNCT00520936 N=72). Patients in both studies received concomitant vitamin B\n and\nfolic acid supplementation and dexamethasone.\nNo tumor responses were observed. Adverse reactions observed in pediatric patients\nwere similar to those observed in adults.\nSingle-dose pharmacokinetics of ALIMTA were evaluated in 22 patients age 4 to 18 years\nenrolled in NCT00070473 were within range of values in adults.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the 3,946 patients enrolled in clinical studies of ALIMTA, 34% were 65 and over and\n4% were 75 and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between\nthese patients and younger patients. The incidences of Grade 3-4 anemia, fatigue,\n12\nthrombocytopenia, hypertension, and neutropenia were higher in patients 65 years of\nage and older as compared to younger patients: in at least one of five randomized\nclinical trials. [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)].\n8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment\nALIMTA is primarily excreted by the kidneys. Decreased renal function results in reduced\nclearance and greater exposure (AUC) to ALIMTA compared with patients with normal\nrenal function [Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nNo dose is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min [see\nDosage and Administration (2.3)].\n10 OVERDOSAGE\nNo drugs are approved for the treatment of ALIMTA overdose. Based on animal studies,\nadministration of leucovorin may mitigate the toxicities of ALIMTA overdosage. It is not\nknown whether pemetrexed is dialyzable.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nALIMTA (pemetrexed for injection) is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor. The drug\nsubstance, pemetrexed disodium heptahydrate, has the chemical name L-glutamic acid,\nN-[4-[2-(2-amino-4,7-dihydro-4-oxo-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl]-,\ndisodium salt, heptahydrate with a molecular formula of C\nH\nN Na O \u20227H O and a\nmolecular weight of 597.49. The structural formula is as follows:\nALIMTA is a sterile white-to-light yellow or green-yellow lyophilized powder in single-dose\nvials to be reconstituted for intravenous infusion. Each 100-mg vial of ALIMTA contains\n100 mg pemetrexed (equivalent to 139.8 mg pemetrexed disodium heptahydrate) and\n106 mg mannitol. Each 500-mg vial of ALIMTA contains 500 mg pemetrexed (equivalent\nto 699 mg pemetrexed disodium heptahydrate) and 500 mg mannitol. Hydrochloric acid\nand/or sodium hydroxide may have been added to adjust pH.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nALIMTA is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor that disrupts folate-dependent metabolic\n20\n19\n5\n2\n6\n2\nprocesses essential for cell replication. In vitro studies show that pemetrexed inhibits\nthymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide\nformyltransferase (GARFT), which are folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo\nbiosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is taken into cells by\nmembrane carriers such as the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding\nprotein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate\nforms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are\nretained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nPemetrexed inhibited the in vitro growth of mesothelioma cell lines (MSTO-211H, NCI-\nH2052) and showed synergistic effects when combined with cisplatin.\nBased on population pharmacodynamic analyses, the depth of the absolute neutrophil\ncounts (ANC) nadir correlates with the systemic exposure to pemetrexed and\nsupplementation with folic acid and vitamin B\n. There is no cumulative effect of\npemetrexed exposure on ANC nadir over multiple treatment cycles.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nAbsorption\nThe pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed when ALIMTA was administered as a single agent\nin doses ranging from 0.2 to 838 mg/m  infused over a 10-minute period have been\nevaluated in 426 cancer patients with a variety of solid tumors. Pemetrexed total\nsystemic exposure (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (C\n) increased\nproportionally with increase of dose. The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed did not\nchange over multiple treatment cycles.\nDistribution\nPemetrexed has a steady-state volume of distribution of 16.1 liters. In vitro studies\nindicated that pemetrexed is 81% bound to plasma proteins.\nElimination\nThe total systemic clearance of pemetrexed is 91.8 mL/min and the elimination half-life of\npemetrexed is 3.5 hours in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance of\n90 mL/min). As renal function decreases, the clearance of pemetrexed decreases and\nexposure (AUC) of pemetrexed increases.\nMetabolism\nPemetrexed is not metabolized to an appreciable extent.\nExcretion\nPemetrexed is primarily eliminated in the urine, with 70% to 90% of the dose recovered\nunchanged within the first 24 hours following administration. In vitro studies indicated\nthat pemetrexed is a substrate of OAT3 (organic anion transporter 3), a transporter\nthat is involved in the active secretion of pemetrexed.\nSpecific Populations\nAge (26 to 80 years) and sex had no clinically meaningful effect on the systemic\nexposure of pemetrexed based on population pharmacokinetic analyses.\n12\n2\nmax\nRacial Groups\nThe pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed were similar in Whites and Blacks or African\nAmericans. Insufficient data are available for other ethnic groups.\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\nPemetrexed has not been formally studied in patients with hepatic impairment. No effect\nof elevated AST, ALT, or total bilirubin on the PK of pemetrexed was observed in clinical\nstudies.\nPatients with Renal Impairment\nPharmacokinetic analyses of pemetrexed included 127 patients with impaired renal\nfunction. Plasma clearance of pemetrexed decreases as renal function decreases, with a\nresultant increase in systemic exposure. Patients with creatinine clearances of 45, 50,\nand 80 mL/min had 65%, 54%, and 13% increases, respectively in systemic exposure\n(AUC) compared to patients with creatinine clearance of 100 mL/min [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].\nThird-Space Fluid\nThe pemetrexed plasma concentrations in patients with various solid tumors with stable,\nmild to moderate third-space fluid were comparable to those observed in patients\nwithout third space fluid collections. The effect of severe third space fluid on\npharmacokinetics is not known.\nDrug Interaction Studies\nDrugs Inhibiting OAT3 Transporter\nIbuprofen, an OAT3 inhibitor, administered at 400 mg four times a day decreased the\nclearance of pemetrexed and increased its exposure (AUC) by approximately 20% in\npatients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance >80 mL/min).\nIn Vitro Studies\nPemetrexed is a substrate for OAT3. Ibuprofen, an OAT3 inhibitor inhibited the uptake of\npemetrexed in OAT3-expressing cell cultures with an average [I ]/IC\n ratio of 0.38. In\nvitro data predict that at clinically relevant concentrations, other NSAIDs (naproxen,\ndiclofenac, celecoxib) would not inhibit the uptake of pemetrexed by OAT3 and would\nnot increase the AUC of pemetrexed to a clinically significant extent. [see Drug\nInteractions (7)].\nPemetrexed is a substrate for OAT4. In vitro, ibuprofen and other NSAIDs (naproxen,\ndiclofenac, celecoxib) are not inhibitors of OAT4 at clinically relevant concentrations.\nAspirin\nAspirin, administered in low to moderate doses (325 mg every 6 hours), does not affect\nthe pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed.\nCisplatin\nCisplatin does not affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed and the pharmacokinetics\nof total platinum are unaltered by pemetrexed.\nVitamins\nu\n50\nNeither folic acid nor vitamin B\n affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed.\nDrugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes\nIn vitro studies suggest that pemetrexed does not inhibit the clearance of drugs\nmetabolized by CYP3A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nNo carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with pemetrexed. Pemetrexed was\nclastogenic in an in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse bone marrow but was not\nmutagenic in multiple in vitro tests (Ames assay, Chinese Hamster Ovary cell assay).\nPemetrexed administered intraperitoneally at doses of \u22650.1 mg/kg/day to male mice\n(approximately 0.0006 times the recommended human dose based on BSA) resulted in\nreduced fertility, hypospermia, and testicular atrophy.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 Non-Squamous NSCLC\nInitial Treatment in Combination with Pembrolizumab and Platinum\nThe efficacy of ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy\nwas investigated in Study KEYNOTE-189 (NCT02578680), a randomized, multicenter,\ndouble-blind, active-controlled trial conducted in patients with metastatic non-squamous\nNSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression status, who had not previously received\nsystemic therapy for metastatic disease and in whom there were no EGFR or ALK\ngenomic tumor aberrations. Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic\ntherapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required\nimmunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within\nthe prior 26 weeks were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by smoking status\n(never versus former/current), choice of platinum (cisplatin versus carboplatin), and\ntumor PD-L1 status (TPS <1% [negative] versus TPS \u22651%). Patients were randomized\n(2:1) to one of the following treatment arms:\nALIMTA 500 mg/m , pembrolizumab 200 mg, and investigator's choice of cisplatin\n75 mg/m  or carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day\ncycle for 4 cycles followed by ALIMTA 500 mg/m  and pembrolizumab 200 mg\nintravenously every 3 weeks. ALIMTA was administered after pembrolizumab and\nprior to platinum chemotherapy on Day 1.\nPlacebo, ALIMTA 500 mg/m , and investigator's choice of cisplatin 75 mg/m  or\ncarboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for\n4 cycles followed by placebo and ALIMTA 500 mg/m  intravenously every 3 weeks.\nTreatment with ALIMTA continued until RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10\ntarget lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ)-defined progression of\ndisease as determined by the investigator or unacceptable toxicity.\nPatients randomized to placebo, ALIMTA, and platinum chemotherapy were offered\npembrolizumab as a single agent at the time of disease progression.\n12\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nAssessment of tumor status was performed at Week 6, Week 12, and then every\n9 weeks thereafter. The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed\nby BICR RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum\nof five target lesions per organ. Additional efficacy outcome measures were ORR and\nduration of response, as assessed by the BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to\nfollow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ.\nA total of 616 patients were randomized: 410 patients to the ALIMTA, pembrolizumab,\nand platinum chemotherapy arm and 206 to the placebo, ALIMTA, and platinum\nchemotherapy arm. The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years\n(range: 34 to 84); 49% age 65 or older; 59% male; 94% White and 3% Asian; 56% ECOG\nperformance status of 1; and 18% with history of brain metastases. Thirty-one percent\nhad tumor PD-L1 expression TPS <1%. Seventy-two percent received carboplatin and\n12% were never smokers. A total of 85 patients in the placebo, ALIMTA, and\nchemotherapy arm received an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody at the time of\ndisease progression.\nThe trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS and PFS for patients\nrandomized to ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy\ncompared with placebo, ALIMTA, and platinum chemotherapy (see Table 10 and Figure\n1).\nTable 10: Efficacy Results of KEYNOTE-189\nEndpoint\nALIMTA \nPembrolizumab \nPlatinum\nChemotherapy \nn=410\nPlacebo \nALIMTA \nPlatinum\nChemotherapy \nn=206\nOS\n        Number (%) of patients with\nevent\n127 (31%)\n108 (52%)\n        Median in months (95% CI)\nNR\n(NR, NR)\n11.3\n(8.7, 15.1)\n        Hazard ratio  (95% CI)\n0.49 (0.38, 0.64)\n        p-value\n<0.0001\nPFS\n        Number of patients with event\n(%)\n245 (60%)\n166 (81%)\n        Median in months (95% CI)\n8.8 (7.6, 9.2)\n4.9 (4.7, 5.5)\n        Hazard ratio  (95% CI)\n0.52 (0.43, 0.64)\n        p-value\n<0.0001\nORR\n    Overall response rate  (95% CI)\n48% (43, 53)\n19% (14, 25)\n        Complete response\n0.5%\n0.5%\n        Partial response\n47%\n18%\n    p-value\n<0.0001\nDuration of Response\n        Median in months (range)\n11.2 (1.1+, 18.0+)\n7.8 (2.1+, 16.4+)\na\nb\na\nb\nc\nd\n Based on the stratified Cox proportional hazard model.\n Based on stratified log-rank test.\n Response: Best objective response as confirmed complete response or partial response.\n Based on Miettinen and Nurminen method stratified by PD-L1 status, platinum chemotherapy and\nsmoking status.\nNR = not reached\n        Median in months (range)\n11.2 (1.1+, 18.0+)\n7.8 (2.1+, 16.4+)\nAt the protocol specified final OS analysis, the median in the ALIMTA in combination with\npembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy arm was 22.0 months (95% CI: 19.5, 24.5)\ncompared to 10.6 months (95% CI: 8.7, 13.6) in the placebo with ALIMTA and platinum\nchemotherapy arm, with an HR of 0.56 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.69).\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier Curve for Overall Survival in KEYNOTE-189*\n*Based on the protocol-specified final OS analysis\nInitial Treatment in Combination with Cisplatin\nThe efficacy of ALIMTA was evaluated in Study JMDB (NCT00087711), a multi-center,\nrandomized (1:1), open-label study conducted in 1725 chemotherapy-naive patients with\nStage IIIb/IV NSCLC. Patients were randomized to receive ALIMTA with cisplatin or\na\nb\nc\nd\ngemcitabine with cisplatin. Randomization was stratified by Eastern Cooperative\nOncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS 0 versus 1), gender, disease stage,\nbasis for pathological diagnosis (histopathological/cytopathological), history of brain\nmetastases, and investigative center. ALIMTA was administered intravenously over 10\nminutes at a dose of 500 mg/m  on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Cisplatin was\nadministered intravenously at a dose of 75 mg/m  approximately 30 minutes after\nALIMTA administration on Day 1 of each cycle, gemcitabine was administered at a dose\nof 1250 mg/m  on Day 1 and Day 8, and cisplatin was administered intravenously at a\ndose of 75 mg/m  approximately 30 minutes after administration of gemcitabine, on Day\n1 of each 21-day cycle. Treatment was administered up to a total of 6 cycles; patients in\nboth arms received folic acid, vitamin B\n, and dexamethasone [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.4)]. The primary efficacy outcome measure was overall survival.\nA total of 1725 patients were enrolled with 862 patients randomized to ALIMTA in\ncombination with cisplatin and 863 patients to gemcitabine in combination with cisplatin.\nThe median age was 61 years (range 26-83 years), 70% were male, 78% were White,\n17% were Asian, 2.9% were Hispanic or Latino, and 2.1% were Black or African\nAmerican, and <1% were other ethnicities.

Patients in both study arms\nreceived folic acid, vitamin B\n, and dexamethasone [see Dosage and Administration\n(2.4)]. Randomization was carried out using a minimization approach [Pocock and Simon\n(1975)] using the following factors: gender, ECOG PS (0 versus 1), response to prior\nchemotherapy (complete or partial response versus stable disease), history of brain\nmetastases (yes versus no), non-platinum component of induction therapy (docetaxel\nversus gemcitabine versus paclitaxel), and disease stage (IIIb versus IV). The major\nefficacy outcome measures were progression-free survival based on assessment by\nindependent review and overall survival; both were measured from the date of\nrandomization in Study JMEN.\nA total of 663 patients were enrolled with 441 patients randomized to ALIMTA and 222\npatients randomized to placebo.

Patients were randomized (n=456) to receive ALIMTA\n500 mg/m  intravenously over 10 minutes followed 30 minutes later by cisplatin\n75 mg/m  intravenously over two hours on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle or to receive\ncisplatin 75 mg/m  intravenously over 2 hours on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle; treatment\ncontinued until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The study was modified after\nrandomization and treatment of 117 patients to require that all patients receive folic acid\n350 mcg to 1000 mcg daily beginning 1 to 3 weeks prior to the first dose of ALIMTA and\ncontinuing until 1 to 3 weeks after the last dose, vitamin B\n 1000 mcg intramuscularly 1\nto 3 weeks prior to first dose of ALIMTA and every 9 weeks thereafter, and\ndexamethasone 4 mg orally, twice daily, for 3 days starting the day prior to each ALIMTA\ndose. Randomization was stratified by multiple baseline variables including KPS, histologic\nsubtype (epithelial, mixed, sarcomatoid, other), and gender. The major efficacy outcome\nmeasure was overall survival and additional efficacy outcome measures were time to\ndisease progression, overall response rate, and response duration.\nA total of 448 patients received at least one dose of protocol-specified therapy; 226\npatients were randomized to and received at least one dose of ALIMTA plus cisplatin,\nand 222 patients were randomized to and received cisplatin. Among the 226 patients\nwho received cisplatin with ALIMTA, 74% received full supplementation with folic acid and\nvitamin B\n during study therapy, 14% were never supplemented, and 12% were\npartially supplemented. Across the study population, the median age was 61 years\n(range: 20 to 86 years); 81% were male; 92% were White, 5% were Hispanic or Latino,\n3.1% were Asian, and <1% were other ethnicities; and 54% had a baseline KPS score of\n90-100% and 46% had a KPS score of 70-80%. With regard to tumor characteristics,\n46% had Stage IV disease, 31% Stage III, 15% Stage II, and 7% Stage I disease at\nbaseline; the histologic subtype of mesothelioma was epithelial in 68% of patients, mixed\nin 16%, sarcomatoid in 10% and other histologic subtypes in 6%. The baseline\ndemographics and tumor characteristics of the subgroup of fully supplemented patients\nwas similar to the overall study population.\nThe efficacy results from Study JMCH are summarized in Table 18 and Figure 9.\nTable 18: Efficacy Results in Study JMCH\nEfficacy Parameter\nAll Randomized and Treated\nPatients \n(N=448)\nFully Supplemented \nPatients \n(N=331)\nALIMTA/Cisplatin\n(N=226)\nCisplatin\n(N=222)\nALIMTA/Cisplatin\n(N=168)\nCisplatin\n(N=163)\nMedian overall survival\n(months)\n12.1\n9.3\n13.3\n10.0\n(95% CI)\n(10.0-14.4)\n(7.8-10.7)\n(11.4-14.9)\n(8.4-11.9)\nHazard ratio\n0.77\n0.75\nLog rank p-value\n0.020\nNA\nb\n2\n2\n2\n12\n12\na\na\nb\n Hazard ratios are not adjusted for stratification variables.\n Not a pre-specified analysis.\nFigure 9: Kaplan-Meier Curves for Overall Survival in Study JMCH\nBased upon prospectively defined criteria (modified Southwest Oncology Group\nmethodology) the objective tumor response rate for ALIMTA plus cisplatin was greater\nthan the objective tumor response rate for cisplatin alone.

ALIMTA is used:\nas the first treatment in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum\nchemotherapy when your lung cancer with no abnormal EGFR or ALK gene has\nspread (advanced NSCLC).\nas the first treatment in combination with cisplatin when your lung cancer has\nspread (advanced NSCLC).\nalone as maintenance treatment after you have received 4 cycles of\nchemotherapy that contains platinum for first treatment of your advanced NSCLC\nand your cancer has not progressed.\nalone when your lung cancer has returned or spread after prior chemotherapy.\nALIMTA is not for use for the treatment of people with squamous cell non-small cell\nlung cancer.\na kind of cancer called malignant pleural mesothelioma. This cancer affects\nthe lining of the lungs and chest wall. ALIMTA is used in combination with cisplatin as\nthe first treatment for malignant pleural mesothelioma that cannot be removed by\nsurgery or you are not able to have surgery.\nALIMTA has not been shown to be safe and effective in children.\nDo not take ALIMTA if you have had a severe allergic reaction to any\nmedicine that contains pemetrexed.\nBefore taking ALIMTA, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical\nconditions, including if you: \nhave kidney problems.\nhave had radiation therapy.\nare pregnant or plan to become pregnant. ALIMTA can harm your unborn baby. \nFemales who are able to become pregnant: \nYour healthcare provider will check to see if you are pregnant before you start\ntreatment with ALIMTA. \nYou should use effective birth control (contraception) during treatment with ALIMTA\nand for 6 months after the last dose. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you\nbecome pregnant or think you are pregnant during treatment with ALIMTA. \nMales with female partners who are able to become pregnant should use effective\nbirth control (contraception) during treatment with ALIMTA and for 3 months after\nthe last dose.\nare breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if ALIMTA passes into breast\nmilk. Do not breastfeed during treatment with ALIMTA and for 1 week after the last\n\u00ae \ndose.\nTell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including\nprescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.\nTell your healthcare provider if you have kidney problems and take a\nmedicine that contains ibuprofen. You should avoid taking ibuprofen for 2 days\nbefore, the day of, and 2 days after receiving treatment with ALIMTA.\nHow is ALIMTA given? \nIt is very important to take folic acid and vitamin B\n during your\ntreatment with ALIMTA to lower your risk of harmful side effects.\nTake folic acid exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider 1 time a day,\nbeginning 7 days (1 week) before your first dose of ALIMTA and continue taking\nfolic acid until 21 days (3 weeks) after your last dose of ALIMTA.\nYour healthcare provider will give you vitamin B\n injections during treatment with\nALIMTA. You will get your first vitamin B\n injection 7 days (1 week) before your\nfirst dose of ALIMTA, and then every 3 cycles.\nYour healthcare provider will prescribe a medicine called corticosteroid for you to\ntake 2 times a day for 3 days, beginning the day before each treatment with ALIMTA.\nALIMTA is given to you by intravenous (IV) infusion into your vein. The infusion is\ngiven over 10 minutes.\nALIMTA is usually given once every 21 days (3 weeks).\nWhat are the possible side effects of ALIMTA? \nALIMTA can cause serious side effects, including: \nLow blood cell counts. Low blood cell counts can be severe, including low white\nblood cell counts (neutropenia), low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), and low red\nblood cell counts (anemia). Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to check your\nblood cell counts regularly during your treatment with ALIMTA. Tell your\nhealthcare provider right away if you have any signs of infection, fever,\nbleeding, or severe tiredness during your treatment with ALIMTA.\nKidney problems, including kidney failure. ALIMTA can cause severe kidney\nproblems that can lead to death. Severe vomiting or diarrhea can lead to loss of\nfluids (dehydration) which may cause kidney problems to become worse. Tell your\nhealthcare provider right away if you have a decrease in amount of urine.\nSevere skin reactions. Severe skin reactions that may lead to death can happen\nwith ALIMTA. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop blisters, skin\nsores, skin peeling, or painful sores, or ulcers in your mouth, nose, throat or genital\narea.\nLung problems (pneumonitis). ALIMTA can cause serious lung problems that can\nlead to death. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get any new or\nworsening symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, or fever.\nRadiation recall. Radiation recall is a skin reaction that can happen in people who\nhave received radiation treatment in the past and are treated with ALIMTA.

The median time to onset was 7 days (1 day to 1.4 years). Dose\ninterruption was required in 9% of patients, and 11% required dose reduction of\nAUGTYRO due to dizziness.\nAtaxia, including gait disturbance and balance disorder, occurred in 28% of patients;\nGrade 3 ataxia occurred in 0.5% of patients. The median time to onset was 15 days (1\nday to 1.4 years). Dose interruption was required in 5% of patients, 8% required dose\nreduction, and one patient (0.2%) permanently discontinued AUGTYRO due to ataxia.\nCognitive impairment, including memory impairment and disturbance in attention,\noccurred in 25% of patients. Cognitive impairment included memory impairment (15%),\ndisturbance in attention (12%), and confusional state (2%); Grade 3 cognitive\nimpairment occurred in 0.9% of patients. The median time to onset of cognitive\ndisorders was 37 days (1 day to 1.4 years). Dose interruption was required in 2% of\npatients, 2.1% required dose reduction, and 0.5% patients permanently discontinued\nAUGTYRO due to cognitive adverse reactions.\nMood disorders occurred in 6% of patients. Mood disorders occurring in > 1% of\npatients included anxiety (2.6%); Grade 4 mood disorders (mania) occurred in 0.2% of\npatients. Dose interruption was required in 0.2% of patients and 0.2% of patients\nrequired a dose reduction due to mood disorders.\nSleep disorders including insomnia and hypersomnia occurred in 18% of patients. Sleep\ndisorders observed in > 1% of patients were somnolence (9%), insomnia (6%) and\nhypersomnia (1.6%). Dose interruption was required in 0.7% of patients, and 0.2% of\npatients required a dose reduction due to sleep disorders.\nThe incidences of CNS adverse reactions observed were similar in patients with and\nwithout CNS metastases.\nAdvise patients and caregivers of the risk of CNS adverse reactions with AUGTYRO.\nAdvise patients not to drive or use machines if they are experiencing CNS adverse\nreactions. Withhold and then resume at same or reduced dose upon improvement, or\npermanently discontinue AUGTYRO based on severity [see Dosage and Administration\n(2.5)].\n5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis\nAUGTYRO can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis.\nAmong the 426 patients treated with AUGTYRO, ILD/pneumonitis (pneumonitis [2.8%]\nand ILD [0.2%]) occurred in 3.1% of patients; Grade 3 ILD/pneumonitis occurred in\n1.2% of patients. The median time to onset was 45 days (19 days to 0.9 years). Dose\ninterruption was required in 1.4% of patients, 0.5% of patients required dose reduction,\nand 1.1% of patients permanently discontinued AUGTYRO due to ILD/pneumonitis.\nMonitor patients for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of\nILD/pneumonitis. Immediately withhold AUGTYRO in patients with suspected\nILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue AUGTYRO if ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed\n[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\n5.3 Hepatotoxicity\nAUGTYRO can cause hepatotoxicity.\nAmong the 426 patients treated with AUGTYRO, increased alanine transaminase (ALT)\noccurred in 38%, increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occurred in 41%,\nincluding Grade 3 or 4 increased ALT in 3.3% and increased AST in 2.9%. The median\ntime to onset of increased ALT or AST was 15 days (range: 1 day to 1.9 years).\nIncreased ALT or AST leading to dose interruptions or reductions occurred in 2.8% and\n1.2% of patients, respectively. Hyperbilirubinemia leading to dose interruptions occurred\nin 0.5%.\nMonitor liver function tests, including ALT, AST and bilirubin, every 2 weeks during the\nfirst month of treatment, then monthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. Withhold\nand then resume at the same or reduced dose upon improvement, or permanently\ndiscontinue AUGTYRO based on the severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\n5.4 Myalgia with Creatine Phosphokinase Elevation\nAUGTYRO can cause myalgia with or without creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation.\nAmong the 426 patients treated with AUGTYRO, myalgia occurred in 13% of patients,\nwith Grade 3 in 0.7%. Median time to onset of myalgia was 19 days (range: 1 day to 2\nyears). Concurrent increased CPK within a 7-day window was observed in 3.7% of\npatients. AUGTYRO was interrupted in one patient with myalgia and concurrent CPK\nelevation.\nAdvise patients to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness.\nMonitor serum CPK levels during AUGTYRO treatment and monitor CPK levels every 2\nweeks during the first month of treatment and as needed in patients reporting\nunexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. Initiate supportive care as clinically\nindicated. Based on severity, withhold and then resume AUGTYRO at the same or\nreduced dose upon improvement [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\n5.5 Hyperuricemia\nAUGTYRO can cause hyperuricemia.\nAmong the 426 patients treated with AUGTYRO, 21 patients (5%) experienced\nhyperuricemia reported as an adverse reaction and 0.7% of patients experienced Grade\n3 or 4 hyperuricemia. One patient without pre-existing gout required urate-lowering\nmedication.\nMonitor serum uric acid levels prior to initiating AUGTYRO and periodically during\ntreatment. Initiate treatment with urate-lowering medications as clinically indicated.\nWithhold and then resume at the same or reduced dose upon improvement, or\npermanently discontinue AUGTYRO based on severity [see Dosage and Administration\n(2.5)].\n5.6 Skeletal Fractures\nAUGTYRO can cause skeletal fractures.\nAmong 426 adult patients who received AUGTYRO, fractures occurred in 2.3%.\nFractures involved the ribs (0.5%), feet (0.5%), spine (0.2%), acetabulum (0.2%),\nsternum (0.2%), and ankles (0.2%). Some fractures occurred at sites of disease and\nprior radiation therapy. The median time to fracture was 71 days (range: 31 days to 1.4\nyears). AUGTYRO was interrupted in 0.3% of patients.\nOf 26 evaluable patients in an ongoing open-label study in pediatric patients, fractures\noccurred in one 12-year-old patient (ankle/foot) and one 10-year-old patient (stress\nfracture). AUGTYRO was interrupted in both patients. AUGTYRO is not approved for use\nin pediatric patients less than 12 years of age [see Pediatric Use (8.4)].\nPromptly evaluate patients with signs or symptoms (e.g., pain, changes in mobility,\ndeformity) of fractures. There are no data on the effects of AUGTYRO on healing of\nknown fractures and risk of future fractures.\n5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on literature reports in humans with congenital mutations leading to changes in\ntropomyosin receptor tyrosine kinase (TRK) signaling, findings from animal studies, and\nits mechanism of action, AUGTYRO can cause fetal harm when administered to a\npregnant woman.\nOral administration of repotrectinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis\nresulted in fetal malformations at doses approximately 0.3 times the recommended 160\nmg twice daily dose based on body surface area (BSA).\nAdvise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive\npotential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with AUGTYRO\nand for 2 months following the last dose, since AUGTYRO can render some hormonal\ncontraceptives ineffective [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].Advise male patients with female\npartners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with\nAUGTYRO and for 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1,\n8.3)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the\nlabeling:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates reported in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe pooled safety population described in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and below\nreflects exposure to AUGTYRO in 426 patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC (n=320),\nNTRK1/2/3-positive solid tumors (n=104), or other solid tumors (n=2) in TRIDENT-1.\nPatients received AUGTYRO at a dose of 160 mg orally once daily for the first 14 days,\nthen increased to 160 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable\ntoxicity [see Clinical Studies (14.1), (14.2)]. Eligible patients had an ECOG status of \u22641.\nPatients with a history of ILD, drug-related pneumonitis, significant, uncontrolled, active\ncardiovascular disease, or prolonged QTc interval were excluded from enrollment in this\ntrial. Forty-eight percent of patients were exposed to AUGTYRO for at least 6 months,\nand 28% were exposed for greater than 1 year.\nThe median age of patients who received AUGTYRO was 57 years (range: 18 to 93);\n59% female; 43% White, 47% Asian, 2.8% Black, 0.5% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific\nIslander, 0.5% American Indian or Alaska Native, 6.1% race not reported or other, and\n0.7% unknown.\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 35% of patients who received AUGTYRO. Serious\nadverse reactions in \u22652% of patients included pneumonia (6.3%), dyspnea (3.1%),\npleural effusion (2.8%), and hypoxia (2.6%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.5% of\npatients who received AUGTYRO, including pneumonia, pneumonia aspiration, cardiac\narrest, sudden cardiac death, cardiac failure, hypoxia, dyspnea, respiratory failure,\ntremor, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.\nPermanent discontinuation of AUGTYRO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 7% of\npatients. There were no specific adverse reactions that accounted for \u22651% of\npermanent discontinuations.\nDosage interruptions of AUGTYRO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 50% of\npatients. Adverse reactions that required dosage interruption in \u22652% of patients were\ndizziness, dyspnea, muscular weakness, ataxia, pneumonia, peripheral neuropathy,\nanemia, and vomiting.\nDose reductions of AUGTYRO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 38% of patients.\nAdverse reactions that required dosage reductions in \u22652% of patients included\ndizziness, ataxia, muscular weakness,

Effects of Other Drugs on AUGTYRO\nStrong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors\nAvoid concomitant use with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Concomitant use of\nAUGTYRO with a strong or a moderate CYP3A inhibitor may increase repotrectinib\nexposure, which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of\nAUGTYRO. Discontinue CYP3A inhibitors for 3 to 5 elimination half-lives of the CYP3A\ninhibitor prior to initiating AUGTYRO [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nP-gp Inhibitors\nAvoid concomitant use with P-gp inhibitors. Concomitant use of AUGTYRO with a P-gp\ninhibitor may increase repotrectinib exposure, which may increase the incidence and\nseverity of adverse reactions of AUGTYRO [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nStrong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers\nAvoid concomitant use with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. Concomitant use of\nAUGTYRO with a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer may decrease repotrectinib plasma\nconcentrations, which may decrease efficacy of AUGTYRO [see Clinical Pharmacology\n(12.3)].\n7.2 Effects of AUGTYRO on Other Drugs\nCertain CYP3A4 Substrates\nAvoid concomitant use unless otherwise recommended in the Prescribing Information\nfor CYP3A substrates, where minimal concentration changes can cause reduced\nefficacy. If concomitant use is unavoidable, increase the CYP3A4 substrate dosage in\naccordance with approved product labeling.\nRepotrectinib is a CYP3A4 inducer. Concomitant use of repotrectinib decreases the\nconcentration of CYP3A4 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which can\nreduce the efficacy of these substrates.\nContraceptives\nRepotrectinib is a CYP3A4 inducer, which can decrease progestin or estrogen exposure\nto an extent that could reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.\nAvoid concomitant use of AUGTYRO with hormonal contraceptives [see Use in Specific\n1\n2\nPopulations (8.1, 8.3)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective\nnonhormonal contraceptive [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on literature reports in humans with congenital mutations leading to changes in\nTRK signaling, findings from animal studies, and its mechanism of action [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.1)], AUGTYRO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant\nwoman. There are no available data on AUGTYRO use in pregnant women. Oral\nadministration of repotrectinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis\nresulted in fetal malformations at doses approximately 0.3 times the recommended dose\nof 160 mg twice daily based on BSA (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential\nrisk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nHuman Data\nPublished reports of individuals with congenital mutations in TRK pathway proteins\nsuggest that decreases in TRK-mediated signaling are correlated with obesity,\ndevelopmental delays, cognitive impairment, insensitivity to pain, and anhidrosis.\nAnimal Data\nIn an embryo-fetal development study, once daily oral administration of repotrectinib to\npregnant rats during the period of organogenesis from gestation day 6 to 17 resulted in\nmaternal effects of increased body weight and skin abrasions/ulcerations at doses \u22656\nmg/kg, fetal malformations of malrotated hindlimbs and lower fetal body weights at\ndoses \u226512 mg/kg [approximately 0.3 times the recommended dose of 160 mg twice\ndaily based on BSA]. No embryolethality was observed.\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of AUGTYRO in human milk or its effects on either\nthe breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse\nreactions in breastfed children from AUGTYRO, advise a lactating woman to discontinue\nbreastfeeding during treatment with AUGTYRO and for 10 days after the last dose.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nAUGTYRO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.1)].\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify the pregnancy status of females of childbearing potential prior to initiating\nAUGTYRO [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nContraception\nAUGTYRO can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see\nUse in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nFemales\nAdvise females of childbearing potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception\nduring treatment with AUGTYRO and for 2 months following the last dose. AUGTYRO can\nrender some hormonal contraceptives ineffective [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].\nMales\nBased on genotoxicity findings, advise male patients with female partners of childbearing\npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with AUGTYRO and for 4\nmonths following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of AUGTYRO in pediatric patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC\nhave not been established.\nThe safety and effectiveness of AUGTYRO have not been established in pediatric patients\nyounger than 12 years of age with solid tumors who have an NTRK gene fusion.\nThe safety and effectiveness of AUGTYRO for the treatment of locally advanced or\nmetastatic NTRK-positive solid tumors have been established in pediatric patients 12\nyears of age or older. Use of AUGTYRO in this age group is supported by evidence from\nan adequate and well-controlled study in adult patients with additional pharmacokinetic\nand safety data in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. This includes data\ndemonstrating that the exposure of repotrectinib in pediatric patients 12 years of age\nand older is expected to result in similar safety and efficacy to that of adults, and that\nthe course of locally advanced or metastatic NTRK-positive solid tumors is sufficiently\nsimilar in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age or older to allow extrapolation of\ndata in adult to pediatric patients 12 years of age or older [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Adverse Reactions (6.1) and\nClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nJuvenile Animal Data\nDaily oral administration of repotrectinib to juvenile rats for 8 weeks starting on\npostnatal day 12 (approximately equal to a human pediatric age of a newborn) resulted\nin toxicities similar to those observed in adult rats, though juvenile animals showed\ndecreased body weight gain at doses \u22651 mg/kg (approximately \u22650.04 times the human\nexposure based on AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 160 mg BID) and\ndecreased femur lengths at 3 mg/kg (approximately 0.1 times the human exposure\nbased on AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 160 mg BID). Decreased body\nweight gain and decreased femur lengths persisted following 4 weeks of recovery.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf the 426 patients who received AUGTYRO, in the TRIDENT-1 study for ROS1-positive\nnon-small cell lung cancer or NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumors, 19% were 65 to\n75 years old, and 6% were 75 years of age or older. There were no clinically meaningful\ndifferences in safety and efficacy between patients younger than 65 years of age and\npatients 65 years of age or older.\n8.6 Renal Impairment\nThe recommended dosage of AUGTYRO has not been established in patients with severe\nrenal impairment or kidney failure (eGFR <30 mL/min) and patients on dialysis [see\nClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nNo dosage modification is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal\nimpairment (eGFR 30 to 90 mL/min).\n8.7 Hepatic Impairment\nThe recommended dosage of AUGTYRO has not been established in patients with\nmoderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 times upper limit of normal [ULN] with any AST) or\nsevere (total bilirubin >3 times ULN with any AST) hepatic impairment [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.3)].\nNo dosage modification is recommended for patients with mild (total bilirubin >1 to 1.5\ntimes ULN or AST > ULN) hepatic impairment.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nRepotrectinib is a kinase inhibitor. The molecular formula for repotrectinib is\nC\nH\nFN O  and the molecular weight is 355.37 Daltons. The chemical name is\n(3R,11S)-6-Fluoro-3,11-dimethyl-10-oxa-2,13,17,18,21-\npentaazatetracyclo[13.5.2.0\n.0\n]docosa-1(21),4,6,8,15(22),16,19-heptaen-14-one.\nThe chemical structure of repotrectinib is as follows:\nRepotrectinib is a white to off-white powder.\nAUGTYRO (repotrectinib) capsules for oral use are supplied as printed hard shell\ncapsules containing 40 mg of repotrectinib. Inactive ingredients are microcrystalline\ncellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate, croscarmellose sodium, and colloidal silicon dioxide.\n18\n18\n5\n2\n4,9\n18,22\nThe white opaque capsule shell contains gelatin and titanium dioxide. The printing ink\ncontains shellac and FD & C blue #2 aluminum lake.\nAUGTYRO (repotrectinib) capsules for oral use are supplied as printed hard shell\ncapsules containing 160 mg of repotrectinib. Inactive ingredients are microcrystalline\ncellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, and\ncolloidal silicon dioxide.\nThe blue opaque capsule shell contains gelatin, titanium dioxide and FD & C blue #1. The\nprinting ink contains shellac and titanium dioxide.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nRepotrectinib is an inhibitor of proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS1 (ROS1) and\nof the tropomyosin receptor tyrosine kinases (TRKs) TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC.\nFusion proteins that include ROS1 or TRK domains can drive tumorigenic potential\nthrough hyperactivation of downstream signaling pathways leading to unconstrained cell\nproliferation. Repotrectinib exhibited anti-tumor activity in cultured cells expressing\nROS1 fusions and mutations including SDC4-ROS1, SDC4-ROS1\n, CD74-ROS1,\nCD74-ROS1\n, CD74-ROS1\n, and CD74-ROS1\n. Repotrectinib also\ninhibited cell proliferation in cultured cells expressing NTRK fusions and mutations\nincluding LMNA-TRKA, LMNA-TRKA\n, EVT6-TRKB\n, and ETV6-TRKC\n.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nRepotrectinib exposure-response relationships and the time course of\npharmacodynamic responses are not fully characterized.\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nAUGTYRO does not cause a mean increase in the QTc interval > 20 milliseconds (ms) at\n160 mg QD followed by 160 mg BID, the approved recommended dosage.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe geometric mean (CV%) of repotrectinib steady state peak concentration (C\n) is\n713 (32.5%) ng/mL and the area under the time concentration curve (AUC\n) is\n7210 (40.1%) ng\u2022h/mL following the approved recommended twice daily dosage in\npatients with cancer. Repotrectinib C\n and AUC\nincreases approximately dose\nproportional (but less than linear with estimated slopes of 0.78 and 0.70, respectively)\nover the single dose range of 40 mg to 240 mg (0.25 to 1.5 times the approved\nrecommended dosage). Steady state PK was time-dependent with an autoinduction of\nCYP3A4. Steady state is achieved within 14 days of daily administration of 160 mg.\nAbsorption\nThe geometric mean (CV%) absolute bioavailability of repotrectinib is 45.7% (19.6%).\nPeak repotrectinib concentration occurred at approximately 2 to 3 hours post a single\noral dose of 40 mg to 240 mg (0.25 to 1.5 times the approved recommended dosage)\nunder fasted conditions.\nG2032R\nG2032R\nD2033N\nL2026M\nG595R\nG639R\nG623R\nmax,ss\n0-24h,ss\nmax\n0-inf \nEffect of Food\nNo clinically significant differences in repotrectinib pharmacokinetics were observed in\npatients with cancer following administration of a high-fat meal (approximately 800-1000\ncalories, 50% fat).\nDistribution\nThe geometric mean (CV%) apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 432 L (55.9 %) in\npatients with cancer following a single 160 mg oral dose of AUGTYRO.\nAUGTYRO binding to plasma protein was 95.4% invitro. The blood-to-plasma ratio was\n0.56 in vitro.\nElimination\nRepotrectinib elimination is time-dependent due to autoinduction of CYP3A4.\nThe repotrectinib mean terminal half-life is approximately 60.7 h for patients with cancer\nfollowing a single dose. The steady state repotrectinib terminal half-life is approximately\n40.3 h for patients with cancer.\nThe geometric mean (CV%) apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 15.9 L/h (45.5%) in\npatients with cancer following a single 160 mg oral dose of AUGTYRO.\nMetabolism\nRepotrectinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 followed by secondary glucuronidation.\nExcretion\nFollowing a single oral 160 mg dose of radiolabeled repotrectinib, 4.84% (0.56% as\nunchanged) was recovered in urine and 88.8% (50.6% unchanged) in feces.\nSpecific Populations\nNo clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of repotrectinib were\nobserved based on age (12 to 93 years), sex, race (White 50%, Asian 38%, Black 7%),\nmild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to < 90 mL/min), or mild hepatic\nimpairment (total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN or AST > ULN). The effect of moderate\n(total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 times ULN with any AST) or severe (total bilirubin >3 x ULN with\nany AST) hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, kidney failure (eGFR < 30\nmL/min), or dialysis on repotrectinib pharmacokinetics is unknown or not fully\ncharacterized.\nDrug Interaction Studies\nClinical Studies\nStrong CYP3A and P-gp inhibitors: Repotrectinib AUC\nincreased by 5.9-fold and C\nby 1.7-fold following concomitant use with itraconazole (strong CYP3A and P-gp\ninhibitor).\nStrong CYP3A and P-gp inducers: Repotrectinib AUC\ndecreased by 92% and C\n by\n79% following concomitant use with rifampin (strong CYP3A and P-gp inducer).\nCYP3A substrates: Midazolam (CYP3A substrate AUC\ndecreased by 69% and C\n by\n48% following concomitant use in subjects who were previously administered 160 mg\nrepotrectinib once daily for 14 days followed by 160 mg twice daily for 7 days.\n0-inf \nmax\n0-inf \nmax\n0-inf \nmax\nIn vitro Studies\nCYP Enzymes: Repotrectinib induces CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and\ninhibits CYP3A4/5 (GI tract). Repotrectinib does not induce CYP1A2.\nOther Metabolic Pathways: Repotrectinib inhibits UGT1A1.\nTransporter Systems: Repotrectinib inhibits P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, and MATE2-K.\nRepotrectinib is a substrate for P-gp.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies with repotrectinib were not conducted.\nRepotrectinib was genotoxic in an in vitro assay in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells and\nin an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay via an aneugenic mechanism of\naction. Repotrectinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames)\nassay.\nDedicated fertility studies were not conducted with repotrectinib. There were no effects\non male and female reproductive organs observed in general repeat-dose toxicology\nstudies of up to 3 months in duration in rats and monkeys at any dose level tested,\nwhich equated to exposures of up to approximately 3 times the human exposure at the\n160 mg twice daily dose based on AUC.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 Locally Advanced or Metastatic ROS1-Positive NSCLC\nThe efficacy of AUGTYRO was evaluated in TRIDENT-1, a multicenter, single-arm, open-\nlabel, multi-cohort clinical trial (NCT03093116). Patients were required to have\nROS1-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, ECOG performance status \u22641,\nmeasurable disease per RECIST v 1.1, and \u22658 months from first dose. All patients were\nassessed for CNS lesions at baseline, and patients with symptomatic brain metastases\nwere excluded from the trial. Patients received AUGTYRO 160 mg orally once daily for 14\ndays, then increased to 160 mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable\ntoxicity. Tumor assessments were performed at least every 8 weeks. Identification of\nROS1 gene fusions in tumor specimens was prospectively determined in local\nlaboratories using next-generation sequencing (NGS), polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) tests. All ROS1-positive patients by local FISH\ntesting required central laboratory confirmation of ROS1 fusion using an analytically\nvalidated NGS test. ROS1 fusions were identified by NGS in 51%, FISH in 26%, and PCR\nin 23%. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and\nduration of response (DOR) according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by blinded\nindependent central review (BICR). Intracranial response according to modified RECIST\nv1.1 was assessed by BICR. Tumor assessments with imaging were performed every 8\nweeks. The efficacy populations included 71 ROS1 TKI-na\u00efve patients who received up to\n1 prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy and 56 patients\nwho received 1 prior ROS1 TKI with no prior platinum-based chemotherapy or\nimmunotherapy.\nAmong the 71 ROS1 TKI-na\u00efve patients, the median age was 57 years (range: 28 to 80);\nfemale (60.6%); Asian (67.6%), White (25.4%), Hispanic or Latino (4.2%), Black or\nAfrican American (1.4%); never smoked (63.4%); and ECOG performance status of 1 at\nbaseline (66.2%). At baseline, 94.4% of patients had metastatic disease, 25.4% of\npatients had CNS metastases by BICR; 97.2% had adenocarcinoma; and 28.2% patients\nhad prior chemotherapy consisting of platinum-based chemotherapy and/or\nimmunotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease.\nAmong the 56 patients who had received 1 prior ROS1 TKI (including crizotinib [82%]\nand entrectinib [16%]) with no prior platinum-based chemotherapy or immunotherapy,\nthe median age was 57 years (range: 33 \u2013 78); female (67.9%); Asian (48.2%), White\n(44.6%), Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino (1.8% each); never smoked\n(64.3%); and ECOG performance status of 1 at baseline (67.9%). At baseline, 98.2%\npatients had metastatic disease, 42.9% with CNS metastases by BICR, and 94.6% had\nadenocarcinoma.\nEfficacy results are summarized in Table 5.\nTable 5: Efficacy Results for Patients with ROS1-Positive NSCLC in TRIDENT-1\nAbbreviations: CI = confidence interval; NE = not evaluable; \u201c+\u201d indicates ongoing\nresponse\n DOR results are based on the updated data as of 19 December 2022.\n Median DOR (95% CI) are based on Kaplan-Meier estimates.\n DOR landmark analysis is based on the observed DOR.\nEfficacy Parameters\nROS1 Inhibitor \nNa\u00efve Patients\n(N=71)\nROS1 Inhibitor\nPretreated Patients\n(N=56)\nConfirmed Overall Response Rate,\n% (95% CI)\n79% (68, 88)\n38% (25, 52)\n   Complete Response\n6%\n5%\n   Partial Response\n73%\n32%\nDuration of Response (DOR)\n   Median in Months (95% CI)\n34.1 (25.6, NE)\n14.8 (7.6, NE)\n   Range (months)\n1.4+, 42.4+\n3.6, 22.9+\n   % DOR \u226512 months\n70\n48\nAmong TKI-na\u00efve patients, 8 had measurable CNS metastases at baseline as assessed\nby BICR; responses in intracranial lesions were observed in 7 of these 8 patients.

All patients were assessed for CNS\nlesions at baseline, and patients with symptomatic brain metastases were excluded from\nthe trial. Patients received AUGTYRO 160 mg orally once daily for 14 days, then\nincreased to 160 mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\nTumor assessments were performed every 8 weeks. NTRK gene fusions were identified\nprospectively using NGS in 94%, FISH in 5%, and PCR in 1%. NTRK gene fusion-positive\ntumors identified by local FISH testing required central laboratory confirmation using an\nanalytically validated NGS test. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and\nDOR according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by BICR. Intracranial response according to\nmodified RECIST v1.1 was assessed by BICR.\nAmong the 40 TRK TKI-na\u00efve patients, the median age was 61 years (range: 25 to 84);\n60% were female patients; race was Asian 53%, White 25%, Black or African American\n5%, and other or not reported 18%; ethnicity was Hispanic or Latino 5%, not Hispanic or\nLatino 87%, and not reported 8%; and ECOG performance status of 1 at baseline was\n55%.

Resume the previous dose 2 to 3 days after discontinuation\nof the P-gp inducer [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nGILOTRIF is available as:\n40 mg tablets: light blue, film-coated, round, biconvex, bevel-edged tablets debossed\nwith \"T40\" on one side and the Boehringer Ingelheim company symbol on the other\nside.\n30 mg tablets: dark blue, film-coated, round, biconvex, bevel-edged tablets debossed\nwith \"T30\" on one side and the Boehringer Ingelheim company symbol on the other\nside.\n2\n20 mg tablets: white to slightly yellowish, film-coated, round, biconvex, bevel-edged\ntablets debossed with \"T20\" on one side and the Boehringer Ingelheim company\nsymbol on the other side.\n4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nNone.\n5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n5.1 Diarrhea\nDiarrhea has resulted in dehydration with or without renal impairment across the clinical\nexperience; some cases were fatal. Grade 3-4 diarrhea occurred in 697 (16%) of the\n4257 patients who received GILOTRIF across 44 clinical trials. In LUX-Lung 3, diarrhea\noccurred in 96% of patients treated with GILOTRIF (n=229), of which 15% were Grade 3\nin severity and occurred within the first 6 weeks. Renal impairment as a consequence of\ndiarrhea occurred in 6% of patients treated with GILOTRIF, of which 1.3% were Grade 3.\nIn LUX-Lung 8, diarrhea occurred in 75% of patients treated with GILOTRIF (n=392), of\nwhich 10% were Grade 3 in severity and 0.8% were Grade 4 in severity. Renal\nimpairment as a consequence of diarrhea occurred in 7% of patients treated with\nGILOTRIF, of which 2% were Grade 3 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nFor patients who develop prolonged Grade 2 diarrhea lasting more than 48 hours or\ngreater than or equal to Grade 3 diarrhea, withhold GILOTRIF until diarrhea resolves to\nGrade 1 or less and resume GILOTRIF with appropriate dose reduction [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3)]. Provide patients with an anti-diarrheal agent (e.g., loperamide) for\nself-administration at the onset of diarrhea and instruct patients to continue anti-\ndiarrheal therapy until loose bowel movements cease for 12 hours.\n5.2 Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Disorders\nGrade 3 cutaneous reactions characterized by bullous, blistering, and exfoliating skin\nlesions, occurred in 0.2% of the 4257 patients who received GILOTRIF across clinical\ntrials. In LUX-Lung 3, the overall incidence of cutaneous reactions consisting of rash,\nerythema, and acneiform rash was 90%, and the incidence of Grade 3 cutaneous\nreactions was 16%. In addition, the incidence of Grade 1-3 palmar-plantar\nerythrodysesthesia syndrome was 7%. In LUX-Lung 8, the overall incidence of\ncutaneous reactions consisting of rash, erythema, and acneiform rash was 70%, and\nthe incidence of Grade 3 cutaneous reactions was 7%. In addition, the incidence of\nGrade 1-3 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome was 1.5% [see Adverse\nReactions (6.1)].\nDiscontinue GILOTRIF in patients who develop life-threatening bullous, blistering, or\nexfoliating skin lesions. For patients who develop prolonged Grade 2 cutaneous adverse\nreactions lasting more than 7 days, intolerable Grade 2 cutaneous reactions, or Grade 3\ncutaneous reactions, withhold GILOTRIF until the adverse reaction resolves to Grade 1\nor less and resume GILOTRIF with appropriate dose reduction [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3)].\nPostmarketing cases consistent with toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens\nJohnson syndrome (SJS) have been reported in patients receiving GILOTRIF. The cases\nof TEN and SJS bullous skin reactions result from a distinct and separate mechanism of\ntoxicity than the bullous skin lesions secondary to the pharmacologic action of the drug\non the epidermal growth factor receptor. Discontinue GILOTRIF if TEN or SJS is\nsuspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease\nInterstitial lung disease or ILD-like adverse reactions (e.g., lung infiltration, pneumonitis,\nacute respiratory distress syndrome, or alveolitis allergic) occurred in 1.6% of the 4257\npatients who received GILOTRIF across clinical trials; of these, 0.4% were fatal. The\nincidence of ILD appeared to be higher in Asian patients (2.3%; 38/1657) as compared\nto Whites (1.0%; 23/2241). In LUX-Lung 3, the incidence of Grade \u22653 ILD was 1.3% and\nresulted in death in 1% of GILOTRIF-treated patients. In LUX-Lung 8, the incidence of\nGrade \u22653 ILD was 0.9% and resulted in death in 0.8% of GILOTRIF-treated patients.\nWithhold GILOTRIF during evaluation of patients with suspected ILD and discontinue\nGILOTRIF in patients with confirmed ILD [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.4 Hepatic Toxicity\nIn 4257 patients who received GILOTRIF across clinical trials, 9.7% had liver test\nabnormalities, of which 0.2% were fatal. In LUX-Lung 3, liver test abnormalities of any\ngrade occurred in 17.5% of the patients treated with GILOTRIF, of which 3.5% had\nGrade 3-4 liver test abnormalities. In LUX-Lung 8, liver test abnormalities of any grade\noccurred in 6% of the patients treated with GILOTRIF, of which 0.2% had Grade 3-4 liver\ntest abnormalities.\nObtain periodic liver testing in patients during treatment with GILOTRIF. Withhold\nGILOTRIF in patients who develop worsening of liver function [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3)]. In patients who develop severe hepatic impairment while taking\nGILOTRIF, discontinue treatment.\n5.5 Gastrointestinal Perforation\nGastrointestinal perforation, including fatal cases, has occurred with GILOTRIF.\nGastrointestinal perforation has been reported in 0.2% of patients treated with GILOTRIF\namong 3213 patients across 17 randomized controlled clinical trials. Patients receiving\nconcomitant corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or anti-\nangiogenic agents, or patients with increasing age or who have an underlying history of\ngastrointestinal ulceration, underlying diverticular disease or bowel metastases may be\nat increased risk of perforation.\nPermanently discontinue GILOTRIF in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation\n[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.6 Keratitis\nKeratitis, characterized as acute or worsening eye inflammation, lacrimation, light\nsensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain, and/or red eye occurred in 0.7% of patients treated\nwith GILOTRIF among 4257 patients across clinical trials, of which 0.05% of patients\nexperienced Grade 3 keratitis. Keratitis was reported in 2.2% patients in LUX-Lung 3,\nwith Grade 3 in 0.4%. In LUX-Lung 8, keratitis was reported in 0.3% patients; there were\nno patients with \u2265Grade 3 keratitis.\nWithhold GILOTRIF during evaluation of patients with suspected keratitis, and if\ndiagnosis of ulcerative keratitis is confirmed, interrupt or discontinue GILOTRIF [see\nDosage and Administration (2.3)]. If keratitis is diagnosed, the benefits and risks of\ncontinuing treatment should be carefully considered. GILOTRIF should be used with\ncaution in patients with a history of keratitis, ulcerative keratitis, or severe dry eye [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)]. Contact lens use is also a risk factor for keratitis and\nulceration.\n5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, GILOTRIF can cause\nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of afatinib to\npregnant rabbits during organogenesis at exposures approximately 0.2 times the\nexposure in humans at the recommended dose of 40 mg daily resulted in\nembryotoxicity and, in rabbits showing maternal toxicity, increased abortions at late\ngestational stages. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the\npotential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective\ncontraception during treatment and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose of GILOTRIF\n[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the\nlabeling:\nDiarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nBullous and Exfoliative Skin Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nInterstitial Lung Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\nHepatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]\nGastrointestinal Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]\nKeratitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe data in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to GILOTRIF for\nclinically significant adverse reactions in 4257 patients enrolled in LUX-Lung 3 (n=229)\nand LUX-Lung 8 (n=392), and 3636 patients with cancer enrolled in 42 studies of\nGILOTRIF administered alone or in combination with other anti-neoplastic drugs at\nGILOTRIF doses ranging from 10-70 mg daily or at doses 10-160 mg in other regimens.\nThe mean exposure was 5.5 months. The population included patients with various\ncancers, the most common of which were NSCLC, breast, colorectal, brain, and head\nand neck.\nThe data described below reflect exposure to GILOTRIF as a single agent in LUX-Lung 3,\na randomized, active-controlled trial conducted in patients with EGFR mutation-positive,\nmetastatic NSCLC, and in LUX-Lung 8, a randomized, active-controlled trial in patients\nwith metastatic squamous NSCLC progressing after platinum-based chemotherapy.\nEGFR Mutation-Positive Metastatic NSCLC\nThe safety of GILOTRIF was evaluated in 229 EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor-na\u00efve\npatients with EGFR mutation-positive, metastatic non-squamous NSCLC enrolled in a\nrandomized (2:1), multicenter, open-label trial (LUX-Lung 3). Patients received either\nGILOTRIF 40 mg daily until documented disease progression or intolerance to the\ntherapy or pemetrexed 500 mg/m\u00b2 followed after 30 minutes by cisplatin 75 mg/m\u00b2\nevery three weeks for a maximum of six treatment courses. The median exposure was\n11 months for patients treated with GILOTRIF and 3.4 months for patients treated with\npemetrexed/cisplatin.\nThe overall trial population had a median age of 61 years; 61% of patients in the\nGILOTRIF arm and 60% of patients in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm were younger than\n65 years. A total of 64% of patients on GILOTRIF and 67% of pemetrexed/cisplatin\npatients were female. More than two-thirds of patients were from Asia (GILOTRIF 70%;\npemetrexed/cisplatin 72%).\nSerious adverse reactions were reported in 29% of patients treated with GILOTRIF. The\nmost frequent serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with GILOTRIF\nwere diarrhea (6.6%); vomiting (4.8%); and dyspnea, fatigue, and hypokalemia (1.7%\neach). Fatal adverse reactions in GILOTRIF-treated patients in LUX-Lung 3 included\npulmonary toxicity/ILD-like adverse reactions (1.3%), sepsis (0.43%), and pneumonia\n(0.43%).\nDose reductions due to adverse reactions were required in 57% of GILOTRIF-treated\npatients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reduction in the patients\ntreated with GILOTRIF were diarrhea (20%), rash/acne (19%), paronychia (14%), and\nstomatitis (10%). Discontinuation of therapy in GILOTRIF-treated patients for adverse\nreactions was 14.0%. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation in\nGILOTRIF-treated patients were diarrhea (1.3%), ILD (0.9%), and paronychia (0.9%).\nClinical trials of GILOTRIF excluded patients with an abnormal left ventricular ejection\nfraction (LVEF), i.e., below the institutional lower limit of normal. In LUX-Lung 3, all\npatients were evaluated for LVEF at screening and every 9 weeks thereafter in the\nGILOTRIF-treated group and as needed in the pemetrexed/cisplatin group. More\nGILOTRIF-treated patients (2.2%; n=5) experienced ventricular dysfunction (defined as\ndiastolic dysfunction, left ventricular dysfunction, or ventricular dilation; all <Grade 3)\ncompared to chemotherapy-treated patients (0.9%; n=1).\nTables 1 and 2 summarize common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities in\nLUX-Lung 3.\nTable 1 Adverse Reactions Reported in \u226510% of GILOTRIF-\nTreated Patients in LUX-Lung 3*\nAdverse Reaction\nGILOTRIF\nn=229\nPemetrexed/Cisplatin\nn=111\nAll Grades\n(%)\nGrade 3  \n(%)\nAll Grades\n(%)\nGrade 3  \n(%)\nGastrointestinal disorders\n  Diarrhea\n96\n15\n23\n2\n  Stomatitis\n71\n9\n15\n1\n\u2020\n\u2020\n1\n*NCI CTCAE v 3.0\nNone of the adverse reactions in this table except stomatitis (one patient\non GILOTRIF [0.4%]) were Grade 4 in severity.\nIncludes stomatitis, aphthous stomatitis, mucosal inflammation, mouth\nulceration, oral mucosa erosion, mucosal erosion, mucosal ulceration\nIncludes acne, acne pustular, dermatitis, acneiform dermatitis,\ndermatosis, drug eruption, erythema, exfoliative rash, folliculitis, rash, rash\nerythematous, rash follicular, rash generalized, rash macular, rash maculo-\npapular, rash pruritic, rash pustular, skin disorder, skin erosion, skin\nexfoliation, skin fissures, skin lesion, skin reaction, skin toxicity, skin ulcer\nIncludes paronychia, nail infection, nail bed infection\n  Cheilitis\n12\n0\n1\n0\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\n  Rash/acneiform\ndermatitis\n90\n16\n11\n0\n  Pruritus\n21\n0\n1\n0\n  Dry skin\n31\n0\n2\n0\nInfections\n  Paronychia\n58\n11\n0\n0\n  Cystitis\n13\n1\n5\n0\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\n  Epistaxis\n17\n0\n2\n1\n  Rhinorrhea\n11\n0\n6\n0\nInvestigations\n  Weight decreased\n17\n1\n14\n1\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\n  Pyrexia\n12\n0\n6\n0\nEye disorders\n  Conjunctivitis\n11\n0\n3\n0\nOther clinically important adverse reactions observed in patients treated with GILOTRIF\nbut that occurred at a higher incidence in pemetrexed/cisplatin-treated patients and not\nlisted elsewhere in section 6 include: decreased appetite (29% Grades 1-4, 4% Grade 3),\nnausea (25% Grades 1-4, 4% Grade 3), and vomiting (23% Grades 1-4, 4% Grade 3).\nTable 2 Laboratory Abnormalities Occurring in \u226510% of GILOTRIF\nArm and at \u22652% Higher Incidence than in Chemotherapy Arm in\nLUX-Lung 3*\nLaboratory Abnormality\nGILOTRIF\nn=229\nPemetrexed/Cisplatin\nn=111\nAll\nGrades\n(%)\nGrades\n3-4\n(%)\nAll Grades\n(%)\nGrades 3-4\n(%)\nIncreased alanine\naminotransferase (ALT)\n54\n2\n27\n1\nIncreased alkaline\n51\n3\n46\n1\n\u2020\n1\n2\n3\n2\n3\n*NCI CTCAE v 3.0\nphosphate\n51\n3\n46\n1\nDecreased creatinine\nclearance\n49\n2\n47\n1\nIncreased aspartate\naminotransferase (AST)\n46\n3\n22\n1\nDecreased lymphocytes\n38\n9\n32\n14\nDecreased potassium\n30\n8\n11\n3\nIncreased bilirubin\n16\n1\n8\n0\nPreviously Treated, Metastatic Squamous NSCLC\nThe safety of GILOTRIF was evaluated in 392 GILOTRIF-treated patients with metastatic\nsquamous NSCLC enrolled in a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial (LUX-Lung 8).\nPatients were required to have received at least four cycles of platinum-based\nchemotherapy, ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1, and normal left ventricular\nejection fraction (LVEF). Patients received GILOTRIF 40 mg once daily (n=392) or\nerlotinib 150 mg once daily (n=395). Treatment continued until documented disease\nprogression or intolerance to the therapy. The median exposure was 2.1 months for\npatients treated with GILOTRIF, 15% were exposed for at least 6 months, and 5% were\nexposed for at least 12 months.\nAmong the 392 GILOTRIF-treated patients, the median age was 65 years, 53% were 65\nyears of age or older, 84% were male, 72% were White, 25% were Asian, ECOG PS 0\n(32%) or 1 (68%).\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients treated with GILOTRIF. The most\nfrequent serious adverse reactions in patients treated with GILOTRIF were pneumonia\n(6.6%), diarrhea (4.6%), and dehydration and dyspnea (3.1% each). Fatal adverse\nreactions in GILOTRIF-treated patients included ILD (0.5%), pneumonia (0.3%),\nrespiratory failure (0.3%), acute renal failure (0.3%), and general physical health\ndeterioration (0.3%).\nThe most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation in GILOTRIF-treated\npatients were diarrhea (4.1%) and rash/acne (2.6%).\nDose reductions due to adverse reactions were required in 27% of GILOTRIF-treated\npatients and discontinuation of GILOTRIF for adverse reactions was required for 20%.\nThe most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reduction in the patients treated\nwith GILOTRIF were diarrhea (15%), rash/acne (5.9%), and stomatitis (3.1%).\nTables 3 and 4 summarize common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities in\nLUX-Lung 8.\nTable 3 Adverse Reactions Reported in \u226510% of GILOTRIF-\nTreated Patients in LUX-Lung 8*\nAdverse Reaction\nGILOTRIF\nn=392\nErlotinib\nn=395\nAll Grades\n(%)\nGrade 3-4\n(%)\nAll Grades\n(%)\nGrade 3-4\n(%)\nGastrointestinal disorders\n*NCI CTCAE v 3.0\nIncludes stomatitis, aphthous stomatitis, mucosal inflammation, mouth\nulceration, oral mucosa erosion, mucosal erosion, mucosal ulceration\nIncludes acne, dermatitis, acneiform dermatitis, eczema, erythema,\nexfoliative rash, folliculitis, rash, rash generalized, rash macular, rash\nmaculo-papular, rash pruritic, rash pustular, skin exfoliation, skin fissures,\nskin lesion, skin reaction, skin toxicity, skin ulcer\nIncludes paronychia, nail infection, nail bed infection\n  Diarrhea\n75\n11\n41\n3\n  Stomatitis\n30\n4\n11\n1\n  Nausea\n21\n2\n16\n1\n  Vomiting\n13\n1\n10\n1\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\n  Rash/acneiform\ndermatitis\n70\n7\n70\n11\n  Pruritus\n10\n0\n13\n0\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\n  Decreased appetite\n25\n3\n26\n2\nInfections\n  Paronychia\n11\n1\n5\n0\nTable 4 Laboratory Abnormalities Occurring in \u226510% of GILOTRIF\nArm and at \u22652% Higher Incidence than in Erlotinib Arm in LUX-\nLung 8*\nLaboratory\nAbnormality\nGILOTRIF\nn=392\nErlotinib\nn=395\nAll Grades\n(%)\nGrades 3-4\n(%)\nAll Grades\n(%)\nGrades 3-\n4\n(%)\n*NCI CTCAE v 3.0\nIncreased alkaline\nphosphate\n34\n2\n31\n0\nDecreased white blood\ncell count\n12\n1\n8\n1\nDecreased potassium\n11\n1\n8\n1\nOther clinically important laboratory abnormalities observed in patients treated with\nGILOTRIF that are not listed in Table 4 are: increased alanine aminotransferase (10%\nGrade 1-4; 1% Grade 3-4), increased aspartate aminotransferase (7% Grade 1-4; 1%\nGrade 3-4), and increased bilirubin (3% Grade 1-4; 0 Grade 3-4).\nLess Common Adverse Reactions\nOther adverse reactions reported in patients treated with GILOTRIF in LUX-Lung 3 and\nLUX-Lung 8 include:\nSkin and subcutaneous disorders: nail disorders occurred in 9.2% and 2.8% of patients,\nrespectively.\n1\n2\n3\n1\n2\n3\n6.2 Postmarketing Experience\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of\nGILOTRIF. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of\nuncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a\ncausal relationship to drug exposure.\nPancreatitis\nToxic epidermal necrolysis/Stevens Johnson syndrome\n7 DRUG INTERACTIONS\nEffect of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Inhibitors and Inducers\nConcomitant taking of P-gp inhibitors (including but not limited to ritonavir, cyclosporine\nA, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, verapamil, quinidine, tacrolimus, nelfinavir,\nsaquinavir, and amiodarone) with GILOTRIF can increase exposure to afatinib [see\nClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Reduce GILOTRIF daily dose as recommended [see\nDosage and Administration (2.5)].\nConcomitant taking of P-gp inducers (including but not limited to rifampicin,\ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and St. John's wort) with GILOTRIF can\ndecrease exposure to afatinib [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Increase GILOTRIF\ndaily dose as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1 Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.1)], GILOTRIF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant\nwoman. There are no available data on the use of GILOTRIF in pregnant women.\nAdministration of afatinib to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis at exposures\napproximately 0.2 times the exposure in humans at the recommended dose of 40 mg\ndaily resulted in embryotoxicity and, in rabbits showing maternal toxicity, increased\nabortions at late gestational stages (see Data). Advise a pregnant woman of the potential\nrisk to a fetus.\nThe background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population\nis unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth\ndefects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to\n20%, respectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nIn an embryo-fetal development study in rabbits, administration of afatinib to pregnant\nanimals at doses of 5 mg/kg (approximately 0.2 times the exposure by AUC at the\nrecommended human dose of 40 mg daily) or greater during the period of\norganogenesis caused increased post-implantation loss, and in animals showing\nmaternal toxicity, abortion at late gestational stages. In the same study, at the high dose\nlevel of 10 mg/kg (approximately 0.7 times the exposure by AUC at the recommended\nhuman dose of 40 mg daily), there were reduced fetal weights, and increases in the\nincidence of runts, as well as visceral and dermal variations. In an embryo-fetal\ndevelopment study in rats, there were skeletal alterations consisting of incomplete or\ndelayed ossifications and reduced fetal weight at a dose of 16 mg/kg (approximately\ntwice the exposure based on AUC at the recommended human dose of 40 mg daily).\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of afatinib in human milk or its effects on the\nbreastfed infant or on milk production. Afatinib was present in the milk of lactating rats\n(see Data). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants\nfrom GILOTRIF, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with GILOTRIF and\nfor 2 weeks after the final dose.\nData\nAfatinib was present in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations 80 and 150 times\nhigher than those found in plasma at 1 and 6 hours after administration.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nContraception\nFemales\nGILOTRIF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise\nfemales of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with\nGILOTRIF and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose of GILOTRIF [see Use in Specific\nPopulations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nInfertility\nBased on results from an animal fertility study, GILOTRIF may reduce fertility in females\nand males of reproductive potential. It is not known if the effects on fertility are\nreversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n8.4 Pediatric Use\nSafety and effectiveness of GILOTRIF in pediatric patients have not been established.\nThe safety and efficacy of afatinib were assessed, but not established, in a single-arm,\nopen-label, multicenter trial [NCT02372006] which included 37 pediatric patients 2 to\n<17 years of age with recurrent/refractory solid tumors with known ErbB pathway\nderegulation who received 80% of the adult dose per body surface area. No new safety\nsignals were observed in pediatric patients in this trial. In these 37 patients, the\npharmacokinetic parameters were within range of values in adults.\n8.5 Geriatric Use\nLUX-Lung 3 did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to\ndetermine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.\nIn LUX-Lung 8, 53% of the 398 patients randomized to receive afatinib were 65 years of\nage or older and 11% were 75 years or older. In an exploratory subgroup analysis of\nLUX-Lung 8, the hazard ratio for overall survival (OS) in patients less than 65 years old\nwas 0.68 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.85) and in patients 65 years or older was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.76,\n1.19). No overall differences in safety were observed between patients 65 years and\nolder and younger patients.\n8.6 Renal Impairment\nPatients with severe renal impairment have a higher exposure to afatinib than patients\nwith normal renal function. Administer GILOTRIF at a starting dose of 30 mg once daily\nin patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min /1.73 m  as determined\nby Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4),\nClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Adjustments to the starting dose of GILOTRIF are not\nnecessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min\n/1.73 m ). GILOTRIF has not been studied in patients with eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m  or\non dialysis.\n8.7 Hepatic Impairment\nGILOTRIF has not been studied in patients with severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic\nimpairment. Adjustments to the starting dose of GILOTRIF are not necessary in patients\nwith mild (Child Pugh A) or moderate (Child Pugh B) hepatic impairment [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.3)]. Closely monitor patients with severe hepatic impairment and\nadjust GILOTRIF dose if not tolerated.\n10 OVERDOSAGE\nOverdose was reported in 2 healthy adolescents each of whom ingested 360 mg of\nGILOTRIF (as part of a mixed-drug ingestion) resulting in nausea, vomiting, asthenia,\ndizziness, headache, abdominal pain, and elevated amylase [<1.5 times upper limit of\nnormal (ULN)]. Both subjects recovered.\n11 DESCRIPTION\nGILOTRIF tablets contain afatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor which is a 4-\nanilinoquinazoline. Afatinib is presented as the dimaleate salt, with the chemical name 2-\nbutenamide, N-[4-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)amino]-7-[[(3S)-tetrahydro-3-furanyl]oxy]-6-\nquinazolinyl]-4-(dimethylamino)-,(2E)-, (2Z)-2-butenedioate (1:2). Its structural formula\nis:\n2\n2\n2\nAfatinib dimaleate is a white to brownish yellow powder, water soluble and hygroscopic,\nwith an empirical formula of C\nH\nClFN O\n, and a molecular weight of 718.1 g/mol.\nGILOTRIF tablets for oral administration are available in 40 mg, 30 mg, or 20 mg of\nafatinib (equivalent to 59.12 mg, 44.34 mg, or 29.56 mg afatinib dimaleate, respectively).\nThe inactive ingredients of GILOTRIF are the following: Tablet Core: lactose\nmonohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide,\nmagnesium stearate and Coating: hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide,\ntalc, polysorbate 80, FD&C Blue No. 2 (40 mg and 30 mg tablets only).\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nAfatinib covalently binds to the kinase domains of EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), and\nHER4 (ErbB4) and irreversibly inhibits tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation, resulting in\ndownregulation of ErbB signaling. Certain mutations in EGFR, including non-resistant\nmutations in its kinase domain, can result in increased autophosphorylation of the\nreceptor, leading to receptor activation, sometimes in the absence of ligand binding, and\ncan support cell proliferation in NSCLC. Non-resistant mutations are defined as those\noccurring in exons constituting the kinase domain of EGFR that lead to increased\nreceptor activation and where efficacy is predicted by 1) clinically meaningful tumor\nshrinkage with the recommended dose of afatinib and/or 2) inhibition of cellular\nproliferation or EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation at concentrations of afatinib\nsustainable at the recommended dosage according to validated methods. The most\ncommonly found of these mutations are exon 21 L858R substitutions and exon 19\ndeletions.\nAfatinib demonstrated inhibition of autophosphorylation and/or in vitro proliferation of\ncell lines expressing wild-type EGFR and in those expressing selected EGFR exon 19\ndeletion mutations, exon 21 L858R mutations, or other less common non-resistant\nmutations, at afatinib concentrations achieved in patients. In addition, afatinib inhibited in\nvitro proliferation of cell lines overexpressing HER2.\nTreatment with afatinib resulted in inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice implanted\nwith tumors either overexpressing wild type EGFR or HER2 or in an EGFR L858R/T790M\ndouble mutant model.\n32\n33\n5\n11\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nThe effect of multiple doses of GILOTRIF (50 mg once daily) on the QTc interval was\nevaluated in an open-label, single-arm study in patients with relapsed or refractory solid\ntumors. No large changes in the mean QTc interval (i.e., >20 ms) were detected in the\nstudy.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nAbsorption\nFollowing oral administration of GILOTRIF tablets, time to peak afatinib plasma\nconcentrations (T\n) is 2 to 5 hours. Maximum concentration (C\n) and area under\nthe concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC\n) values increased\nslightly more than dose proportional in the range of 20 to 50 mg. The geometric mean\nrelative bioavailability of 20 mg GILOTRIF tablets was 92% as compared to an oral\nsolution. Steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved within 8 days of repeat\ndosing of GILOTRIF resulting in an accumulation of 2.8-fold for AUC and 2.1-fold for\nC\n.\nEffect of Food\nA high-fat meal decreased C\n by 50% and AUC\n by 39% relative to the fasted\ncondition [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].\nDistribution\nIn vitro binding of afatinib to human plasma proteins is approximately 95%.\nElimination\nThe elimination half-life of afatinib is 37 hours after repeat dosing in cancer patients.\nMetabolism\nCovalent adducts to proteins are the major circulating metabolites of afatinib and\nenzymatic metabolism of afatinib is minimal. The metabolites formed by CYP450-\ndependent reactions were approximately 9% of the total metabolic turnover in\nsandwich-cultured human hepatocytes. Approximately 2% of the afatinib dose was\nmetabolized by FMO3; the CYP3A4-dependent N-demethylation was not detected.\nExcretion\nIn humans, excretion of afatinib is primarily via the feces (85%) with 4% recovered in the\nurine following a single oral dose of [\nC]-labeled afatinib solution. The parent compound\naccounted for 88% of the recovered dose.\nSpecific Populations\nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, weight, gender, age, and race do not\nhave a clinically important effect on exposure of afatinib.\nPatients with Renal Impairment\nA pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 14 subjects with normal (eGFR \u226590\nmL/min/1.73 m ) renal function, 8 subjects with moderate (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73\nm ) and 8 subjects with severe (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m ) renal impairment. All\nmax\nmax\n0-INF\nmax\nmax\n0-INF\n14\n2\n2\n2\nsubjects received a single 40 mg oral dose of GILOTRIF. The geometric mean AUC\n for\nafatinib was 50% higher in subjects with severe renal impairment and was 22% higher in\nsubjects with moderate renal impairment as compared to subjects with normal renal\nfunction. Geometric mean C\n was 22% higher in subjects with severe renal\nimpairment and was comparable in subjects with moderate renal impairment to subjects\nwith normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific\nPopulations (8.6)]. GILOTRIF has not been studied in patients with eGFR <15\nmL/min/1.73 m  or on dialysis.\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\nMild (Child Pugh A) or moderate (Child Pugh B) hepatic impairment had no influence on\nthe afatinib exposure following a single dose of GILOTRIF. Subjects with severe (Child\nPugh C) hepatic impairment have not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations\n(8.7)].\nDrug Interactions Studies\nClincial Studies\nEffect of P-gp Inhibitors and Inducers on Afatinib: The effect of ritonavir dosing time\nrelative to a single oral dose of GILOTRIF was evaluated in healthy subjects taking 40 mg\nof GILOTRIF alone as compared to those after ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 3 days)\nco-administration at 6 hours after GILOTRIF administration. The relative bioavailability for\nAUC\n and C\n of afatinib was 119% and 104% when co-administered with ritonavir,\nand 111% and 105% when ritonavir was administered 6 hours after taking GILOTRIF. In\nanother study, when ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 3 days) was administered 1 hour\nbefore a 20 mg single dose of GILOTRIF, exposure to afatinib increased by 48% for\nAUC\n and 39% for C\n [see Drug Interactions (7)].\nPre-treatment with a potent inducer of P-gp, rifampicin (600 mg once daily for 7 days)\ndecreased the plasma exposure to afatinib by 34% (AUC\n) and 22% (C\n) [see Drug\nInteractions (7)].\nIn Vitro Studies\nEffect of Afatinib on P-gp: Based on in vitro data, afatinib is an inhibitor of P-gp.\nInteraction of Afatinib with BCRP: Based on in vitro data, afatinib is a substrate and an\ninhibitor of the transporter BCRP.\nEffect of Afatinib on CYP450 Enzymes: Afatinib is not an inhibitor or an inducer of\nCYP450 enzymes (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4) in cultured primary human\nhepatocytes.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with afatinib.\nA marginal response to afatinib was observed in a single tester strain of a bacterial\n(Ames) mutagenicity assay. No mutagenic or genotoxic potential was identified in an in\nvitro chromosomal aberration test at non-cytotoxic concentrations as well as in the in\nvivo bone marrow micronucleus assay, the in vivo Comet assay, and an in vivo 4-week\nINF\nmax\n2\n0-INF\nmax\n0-INF\nmax\n0-INF\nmax\n\u2122\noral mutation study in the Muta  Mouse.\nIn a dedicated fertility study, male and female rats received afatinib daily by oral\nadministration at doses of 4, 6, or 8 mg/kg. In males at doses of 6 mg/kg\n(approximately equal to the exposure by AUC in patients at the recommended human\ndose of 40 mg daily) or greater, there was an increase in the incidence of low or no\nsperm count, though overall fertility was not affected; decreases in sperm count were\nsupported by findings of increased apoptosis in the testes and atrophy in the seminal\nvesicles and the prostate in general toxicology studies. In females at the high dose of 8\nmg/kg (approximately 0.63 times the exposure by AUC in patients at the recommended\nhuman dose of 40 mg daily), there was a mild decrease in the number of corpora lutea\nalong with a mild increase in post-implantation loss due to early resorptions. In a 4-week\ngeneral toxicology study, female rats had decreases in ovarian weights at all dose levels;\norgan weight had not fully recovered by the end of a 2-week recovery period.\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1 EGFR Mutation-Positive, Metastatic NSCLC\nThe efficacy of GILOTRIF for the first-line treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-\npositive, metastatic [Stage IV and Stage IIIb with pleural and/or pericardial effusion as\nclassified by the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC, 6th edition)] NSCLC was\nestablished in a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial (LUX-Lung 3 [NCT00949650]).\nPatients were randomized (2:1) to receive GILOTRIF 40 mg orally once daily (n=230) or\nintravenous pemetrexed (500 mg/m ) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m ) once every 21 days for\nup to 6 cycles (n=115). Randomization was stratified according to EGFR mutation\ncategory (exon 19 deletion vs exon 21 L858R vs other) and race (Asian vs non-Asian).\nThe major efficacy outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by an\nindependent review committee (IRC). Other efficacy outcomes included overall response\nrate (ORR) and OS. EGFR mutation status was prospectively determined for screening\nand enrollment of patients by a clinical trial assay (CTA). Tumor samples from 264\npatients (178 randomized to GILOTRIF and 86 patients randomized to chemotherapy)\nwere tested retrospectively by the companion diagnostic therascreen\n EGFR RGQ PCR\nKit, which is FDA-approved for selection of patients for GILOTRIF treatment.\nAmong the patients randomized, 65% were female, median age was 61 years, baseline\nECOG performance status (PS) was 0 (39%) or 1 (61%), 26% were White and 72% were\nAsian. The majority of the patients had a tumor sample with an EGFR mutation\ncategorized by the CTA as either exon 19 deletion (49%) or exon 21 L858R substitution\n(40%), while the remaining 11% had other mutations.\nA statistically significant improvement in PFS as determined by the IRC was\ndemonstrated for patients randomized to GILOTRIF compared with those randomized to\nchemotherapy. See Table 5 and Figure 1. There was no statistically significant difference\nfor OS between the treatment arms at the final pre-planned analysis.\nTable 5 Efficacy Results in LUX-Lung 3\nGILOTRIF\n(N=230)\nPemetrexed/Cisplatin\n(N=115)\nProgression-Free Survival by IRC\n\u2122\n2\n2\n\u00ae\n*Stratified by EGFR mutation status and race.\nHR=hazard ratio; CR=complete response; PR=partial response\nNumber of Deaths or\nProgressions, N (%)\n152 (66.1%)\n69 (60.0%)\n  Median Progression-Free\nSurvival (months)\n11.1\n6.9\n  95% CI\n(9.6, 13.6)\n(5.4, 8.2)\n  HR (95% CI)\n0.58 (0.43, 0.78)\n  Stratified Log-Rank Test p-\nvalue*\n<0.001\nOverall Survival\nNumber of Deaths, N (%)\n140 (60.9%)\n73 (63.5%)\n  Median Overall Survival\n(months)\n28.2\n28.2\n  95% CI\n(24.6, 33.6)\n(20.7, 33.2)\n  HR (95% CI)\n0.88 (0.66, 1.17)\n  Stratified Log-Rank Test p-\nvalue*\n0.39\nOverall Response Rate (CR + PR) by IRC\nN (%)\n116 (50.4%)\n22 (19.1%)\nResponse Duration\nMedian (months)\n12.5\n6.7\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier Curve for PFS by Independent Review by Treatment\nGroup in LUX-Lung 3\nPre-specified exploratory subgroup analyses were conducted according to the\nstratification factor of EGFR mutation category. See Figure 2 and text below Figure 2.\nFigure 2 Forest Plots of PFS and OS by EGFR Mutation Subgroups in LUX-\nLung 3\nOverall Response Rate in Other EGFR Mutations\nThe efficacy of GILOTRIF in patients with NSCLC harboring non-resistant EGFR\nmutations (S768I, L861Q, and G719X) other than exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R\nsubstitutions was evaluated in a pooled analysis of such patients enrolled in one of three\nclinical trials (LUX-Lung 2 [NCT00525148], LUX-Lung 3 [NCT00949650], and LUX-Lung 6\n[NCT01121393]).\nLUX-Lung 2 was a single arm, multicenter study of afatinib 40 or 50 mg orally once\ndaily until disease progression or intolerable side effects. EGFR status was\ndetermined by bi-directional Sanger sequencing of tumor tissue.\nLUX-Lung 3 was a randomized, multicenter study comparing treatment with afatinib\n40 mg orally once daily to intravenous cisplatin 75 mg/m  plus pemetrexed 500\nmg/m  every 21 days for up to 6 cycles. EGFR status was determined by the\ntherascreen\n EGFR RGQ PCR Kit.\nLUX-Lung 6 was a randomized, multicenter study comparing treatment with afatinib\n40 mg to intravenous gemcitabine 1000 mg/m  on day 1 and day 8 plus cisplatin 75\nmg/m  on day 1 of a 3-week schedule for up to 6 cycles. EGFR status was\ndetermined by the therascreen\n EGFR RGQ PCR Kit.\nAmong the 75 GILOTRIF-treated patients with uncommon EGFR mutations, 32 patients\nhad a non-resistant EGFR mutation. Among the 32 patients with a confirmed non-\nresistant EGFR mutation, the median age was 60.5 years (range 32-79), 66% were\nfemale, 97% were Asian, 3% were other races, 38% had an ECOG PS of 0, 63% had an\nECOG PS 1, 66% were never smokers, 28% were former smokers, and 6% were current\nsmokers. Baseline disease characteristics were 97% Stage IV disease, 3% Stage IIIb\ndisease, and 88% had received no prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic\ndisease.\nThe number of patients, the number of responders, and durations of response in\nsubgroups defined by identified mutation(s) are summarized in Table 6.\nTable 6 IRC-Assessed Responses in Patients with NSCLC\nHarboring EGFR Mutations G719X, L861Q, and/or S768I from LUX-\nLung 2, LUX-Lung 3, and LUX-Lung 6\nEGFR\nMutation\nNumber of\nGILOTRIF\nTreated\nPatients\n(N=32)\nNumber of\nConfirmed\nResponses\n(N=21)\nDuration of Response\n(months)\n(N=21)\nS768I\n1\n1\n37.3\nS768I and\nG719X\n5\n4\n4.1, 13.2, 15.2, 29.5+\nS768I and\nL858R\n2\n1\n34.5+\nG719X\n8\n6\n5.7+, 8.1, 9.6, 23.5+, 25.2,\n31.8+\nG719X and\nL861Q\n3\n2\n2.8+, 6.8\nL861Q\n12\n7\n2.8, 4.0, 4.1, 8.3+, 12.9,\n2\n2\n\u00ae\n2\n2\n\u00ae\n+ response ongoing at time of censoring\nL861Q\n12\n7\n15.2, 20.6\nL861Q and Del\n19\n1\n0\nNA\n14.2 Previously Treated, Metastatic Squamous NSCLC\nThe efficacy and safety of GILOTRIF were demonstrated in a randomized, multicenter,\nopen-label, active-controlled study (LUX-Lung 8 [NCT01523587]). Patients were required\nto have histologically documented, metastatic squamous NSCLC and have experienced\ndisease progression following an adequate course (\u22654 cycles) of a platinum-based\ndoublet chemotherapy regimen. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive GILOTRIF 40\nmg or erlotinib 150 mg orally once daily until progression. Randomization was stratified\nby region (Eastern Asia vs other). The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS as\nassessed by an IRC using RECIST v 1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures were OS\nand ORR as assessed by IRC.\nBaseline patient demographics of the 795 patients were: median age 64 years (range: 35\nto 88); 73% White; 24% Asian; 84% male; 33% ECOG PS 0 and 67% ECOG PS 1; and\n95% current or former smokers. With regard to tumor characteristics, 96% had\nsquamous cell histology and 3.5% had mixed cell histology. All patients received\nplatinum-based doublet therapy.\nThe study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS and OS for\npatients randomized to GILOTRIF as compared with erlotinib (see Table 7 and Figure 3).\nTable 7 Efficacy Results in LUX-Lung 8\nGILOTRIF\nErlotinib\n*Log-rank test stratified by region.\nHR=hazard ratio\nOverall Survival\nN=398\nN=397\nNumber of Deaths, N (%)\n307 (77%)\n325 (82%)\n  Median overall survival (months)\n7.9\n6.8\n  95% CI\n(7.2, 8.7)\n(5.9, 7.8)\n  HR (95% CI)\n0.81 (0.69, 0.95)\n  p-value*\n0.008\nProgression-Free Survival (PFS) by IRC\nN=335\nN=334\nNumber of Events, N (%)\n202 (60%)\n212 (64%)\n  Median PFS (months)\n2.4\n1.9\n  95% CI\n(1.9, 2.9)\n(1.9, 2.2)\n  HR (95% CI)\n0.82 (0.68, 0.998)\n  p-value*\n0.0427\nOverall Response Rate (ORR) by IRC\nN=335\nN=334\n  ORR\n3%\n2%\n  (95% CI)\n(1.7, 5.8)\n(0.8, 4.3)\nFigure 3 Kaplan-Meier Curves of Overall Survival in LUX-Lung 8\n16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING\nGILOTRIF tablets are available as follows:\n40 mg: light blue, film-coated, round, biconvex, bevel-edged tablets debossed with \"T40\"\non one side and the Boehringer Ingelheim company symbol on the other side.\nUnit of use bottles of\n30\nNDC: 0597-0138-30\n30 mg: dark blue, film-coated, round, biconvex, bevel-edged tablets debossed with\n\"T30\" on one side and the Boehringer Ingelheim company symbol on the other side.\nUnit of use bottles of\n30\nNDC: 0597-0137-30\n20 mg: white to slightly yellowish, film-coated, round, biconvex, bevel-edged tablets\ndebossed with \"T20\" on one side and the Boehringer Ingelheim company symbol on the\nother side.\nUnit of use bottles of\n30\nNDC: 0597-0141-30\nStorage\nStore at 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F); excursions permitted to 15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C (59\u00b0 to 86\u00b0F)\n[see USP Controlled Room Temperature].

Basal cell carcinoma and new primary\nmelanoma occurred in 4% and 1% of patients, respectively.\nTAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Adult): In the pooled safety population [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)], the incidence of cuSCC (including keratoacanthomas)\noccurred in 2% of patients. Basal cell carcinoma and new primary melanoma occurred in\n3% and < 1% of patients, respectively.\nTAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Pediatric): In the pooled safety population, new\nprimary melanoma occurred in < 1% of patients.\nPerform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiation of TAFINLAR, every 2 months while\non therapy, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of TAFINLAR.\nNon-Cutaneous Malignancies\nBased on its mechanism of action, TAFINLAR may promote the growth and development\nof malignancies with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms [see\nWarnings and Precautions (5.2)].\nIn the pooled adult safety populations of TAFINLAR monotherapy and TAFINLAR\nadministered with trametinib [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], non-cutaneous malignancies\noccurred in 1% of patients.\nMonitor patients receiving TAFINLAR for signs or symptoms of non-cutaneous\nmalignancies. Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR for RAS mutation-positive non-\ncutaneous malignancies [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\n5.2       Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors\nIn vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP-kinase signaling\nand increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells which are exposed to BRAF\ninhibitors. Confirm evidence of BRAF V600E or V600K mutation status prior to initiation\nof TAFINLAR as a single agent or in combination with trametinib [see Indications and\nUsage (1.6), Dosage and Administration (2.1)].\n5.3       Hemorrhage\nHemorrhage, including major hemorrhage defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical\narea or organ, can occur when TAFINLAR is administered with trametinib. Fatal cases\nhave been reported.\nTAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Adult): In the pooled safety population [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)], hemorrhagic events occurred in 17% of patients;\ngastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in 3% of patients; intracranial hemorrhage\noccurred in 0.6% of patients; fatal hemorrhage occurred in 0.5% of patients. The fatal\nevents were cerebral hemorrhage and brainstem hemorrhage.\nTAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Pediatric): In the pooled safety population,\nhemorrhagic events occurred in 25% of patients; the most common type of bleeding\nwas epistaxis (16%). Serious events of bleeding occurred in 3.6% of patients and\nincluded gastrointestinal hemorrhage (1.2%), cerebral hemorrhage (0.6%) uterine\nhemorrhage (0.6%), post-procedural hemorrhage (0.6%), and epistaxis (0.6%).\nPermanently discontinue TAFINLAR for all Grade 4 hemorrhagic events and for any\nGrade 3 hemorrhagic events that do not improve. Withhold TAFINLAR for Grade 3\nhemorrhagic events; if improved, resume TAFINLAR at the next lower dose level.\n5.4       Cardiomyopathy\nTAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Adult): In the pooled safety population [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)], cardiomyopathy, defined as a decrease in left ventricular\nejection fraction (LVEF) \u2265 10% from baseline and below the institutional lower limit of\nnormal (LLN), occurred in 6% of patients. Development of cardiomyopathy resulted in\ndose interruption or discontinuation of TAFINLAR in 3% and < 1% of patients,\nrespectively. Cardiomyopathy resolved in 45 of 50 patients who received TAFINLAR\nadministered with trametinib.\nTAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Pediatric): In the pooled safety population,\ncardiomyopathy, defined as a decrease in LVEF \u2265 10% from baseline and below the\ninstitutional LLN, occurred in 9% of patients.\nAssess LVEF by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan before initiation\nof TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib, one month after initiation, and then at 2- to\n3-month intervals while on treatment. Withhold TAFINLAR for symptomatic\ncardiomyopathy or asymptomatic LV dysfunction of > 20% from baseline that is below\ninstitutional LLN. Resume TAFINLAR at the same dose level upon recovery of cardiac\nfunction to at least the institutional LLN for LVEF and absolute decrease \u2264 10%\ncompared to baseline [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\n5.5       Uveitis\nTAFINLAR Monotherapy (Adult): In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions\n(6.1)], uveitis occurred in 1% of patients.\nTAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Adult): In the pooled safety population [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)], uveitis occurred in 2% of patients.\nTAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Pediatric): In the pooled safety population,\nuveitis occurred in 1.2% of patients.\nTreatment employed in clinical trials included steroid and mydriatic ophthalmic drops.\nMonitor patients for visual signs and symptoms of uveitis (e.g., change in vision,\nphotophobia, eye pain). If iritis is diagnosed, administer ocular therapy and continue\nTAFINLAR without dose modification. If severe uveitis (i.e., iridocyclitis) or if mild or\nmoderate uveitis does not respond to ocular therapy, withhold TAFINLAR and treat as\nclinically indicated. Resume TAFINLAR at the same or lower dose if improves to Grade 0\nor 1. Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR for persistent Grade 2 or greater uveitis of > 6\nweeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\n5.6       Serious Febrile Reactions\nSerious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or\nchills, dehydration, or renal failure, can occur with TAFINLAR.\nThe incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased when TAFINLAR is administered with\ntrametinib compared with TAFINLAR as a single agent [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nTAFINLAR Monotherapy (Adult): In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions\n(6.1)], fever (serious and non-serious) occurred in 30% of patients. Approximately 13%\nof these patients experienced 3 or more discrete episodes. Serious febrile reactions and\nfever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills occurred in 6% of\npatients.\nTAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Adult): In the pooled safety population [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)], fever occurred in 58% of patients. Serious febrile reactions\nand fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration or\nrenal failure occurred in 5% of patients. Fever was complicated by hypotension in 4%,\ndehydration in 3%, syncope in 2%, renal failure in 1%, and severe chills/rigors in < 1% of\npatients.\nTAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Pediatric): In the pooled safety population [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)], pyrexia occurred in 66% of patients.\nWithhold TAFINLAR when used as monotherapy, and both TAFINLAR and trametinib\nwhen used in combination, if the patient\u2019s temperature is \u2265 100.4\u00b0F. In case of\nrecurrence, therapy can also be interrupted at the first symptom of pyrexia [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)]. Fever may be complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills,\ndehydration, or renal failure. Evaluate for signs and symptoms of infection and monitor\nserum creatinine and other evidence of renal function during and following severe\npyrexia. If appropriate, TAFINLAR, or both TAFINLAR and trametinib when used in\ncombination, may be restarted if the patient has recovered from the febrile reaction for\nat least 24 hours, either at the same or lower dose [see Dosage and Administration\n(2.4)]. Administer antipyretics as secondary prophylaxis when resuming TAFINLAR if\npatient had a prior episode of severe febrile reaction or fever associated with\ncomplications. Administer corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 10 mg daily) for at least 5\ndays for second or subsequent pyrexia if temperature does not return to baseline within\n3 days of onset of pyrexia, or for pyrexia associated with complications, such as\ndehydration, hypotension, renal failure, or severe chills/rigors, and there is no evidence\nof active infection.\n5.7       Serious Skin Toxicities\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome\n(SJS) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which can be\nlife-threatening or fatal, have been reported during treatment with TAFINLAR\nadministered with trametinib [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].\nTAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Adult): In the pooled safety population [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)], other serious skin toxicity occurred in < 1% of patients.\nTAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Pediatric): In the pooled safety population,\nserious adverse events of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders occurred in 1.8% of\npatients.\nMonitor for new or worsening serious skin reactions. Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR\nfor SCARs [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. For other skin toxicities, withhold\nTAFINLAR for intolerable or severe skin toxicity. Resume TAFINLAR at a lower dose in\npatients with improvement or recovery from skin toxicity within 3 weeks. Permanently\ndiscontinue TAFINLAR if skin toxicity has not improved within 3 weeks [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.4)].\n5.8       Hyperglycemia\nTAFINLAR Monotherapy (Adult): In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions\n(6.1)], 14% of patients with a history of diabetes that received TAFINLAR required more\nintensive hypoglycemic therapy. Grade 3 and Grade 4 hyperglycemia occurred in 3% of\npatients.\nTAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Adult): In the pooled safety population [see\nAdverse Reactions (6.1)], 15% of patients with a history of diabetes who had received\nTAFINLAR with trametinib required more intensive hypoglycemic therapy. Grade 3 and\nGrade 4 hyperglycemia occurred in 2% of patients.\nTAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Pediatric): In the pooled safety population,\nGrade 3 and Grade 4 hyperglycemia events occurred in < 1% of patients.\nMonitor serum glucose levels upon initiation and as clinically appropriate when TAFINLAR\nis administered in patients with preexisting diabetes or hyperglycemia. Initiate or\noptimize anti-hyperglycemic medications as clinically indicated.\n5.9       Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency\nTAFINLAR, which contains a sulfonamide moiety, confers a potential risk of hemolytic\nanemia in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Monitor\npatients with G6PD deficiency for signs of hemolytic anemia while taking TAFINLAR.\n5.10       Risks Associated with Combination Treatment\nTAFINLAR is indicated for use in combination with trametinib. Review the prescribing\ninformation for trametinib for information on the serious risks of trametinib prior to\ninitiation of TAFINLAR with trametinib.\n5.11       Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has been observed in the post-marketing\nsetting when TAFINLAR was administered with trametinib. If HLH is suspected, interrupt\ntreatment. If HLH is confirmed, discontinue treatment and initiate appropriate\nmanagement of HLH.\n5.12       Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, TAFINLAR can\ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Dabrafenib was teratogenic\nand embryotoxic in rats at doses three times greater than the human exposure at the\nrecommended adult clinical dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a\nfetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal\ncontraception, since TAFINLAR can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective, during\ntreatment with TAFINLAR and for 2 weeks after the last dose [see Drug Interactions\n(7.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].\n6       ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the\nlabeling:\nNew Primary Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nTumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nHemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\nCardiomyopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]\nUveitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]\nSerious Febrile Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]\nSerious Skin Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]\nHyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]\nGlucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions\n(5.9)]\nHemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]\nThere are additional adverse reactions associated with trametinib. Refer to the trametinib\nprescribing information for additional information.\n6.1       Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nAdult Safety Pools\nThe pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects\nexposure to TAFINLAR 150 mg orally, twice daily as a single agent in 586 patients with\nvarious solid tumors, including BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic\nmelanoma, enrolled in BREAK-2, BREAK-3, BREAK-MB, BRF113220, and BRF112680.\nAmong these 586 patients who received TAFINLAR as a single agent, 46% were exposed\nfor 6 months or longer and 15% were exposed for greater than one year.\nThe pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects\nexposure to TAFINLAR 150 mg orally, twice daily administered in combination with\ntrametinib 2 mg orally, once daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583,\nMEK111504, COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or\nmetastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who\nreceived TAFINLAR administered with trametinib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or\nlonger and 21% were exposed for greater than one year.\nPediatric Safety Pool\nThe pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\nreflects exposure to weight-based TAFINLAR orally, twice daily administered in\ncombination with trametinib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center,\nopen-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive\nglioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-\nlabel, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors\nwith MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)].\nAmong 166 patients who received TAFINLAR administered with trametinib, 84% were\nexposed for 6 months or longer and 70% were exposed for greater than one year. The\nmost common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache\n(40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%),\ndiarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal\npain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4\nlaboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine\naminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%).\nUnresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma\nTAFINLAR as a Single Agent\nThe safety of TAFINLAR was evaluated in BREAK-3, a multi-center, international, open-\nlabel, randomized (3:1), controlled trial that allocated 250 patients with unresectable or\nmetastatic BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma to receive TAFINLAR 150 mg orally\ntwice daily (n = 187) or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m  intravenously every 3 weeks (n = 63)\n[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The trial excluded patients with abnormal LVEF or cardiac\nvalve morphology (\u2265 Grade 2), corrected QT interval \u2265 480 milliseconds on\nelectrocardiogram, or a known history of G6PD deficiency. The median duration on\ntreatment was 4.9 months for patients treated with TAFINLAR and 2.8 months for\ndacarbazine-treated patients. The population exposed to TAFINLAR was 60% male, 99%\nWhite, and had a median age of 53 years.\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) in patients treated with TAFINLAR were,\nin order of decreasing frequency: hyperkeratosis, headache, pyrexia, arthralgia,\npapilloma, alopecia, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES).\nThe incidence of adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of study\nmedication in the BREAK-3 study was 3% for patients treated with TAFINLAR and 3% for\npatients treated with dacarbazine. The most frequent (\u2265 2%) adverse reactions leading\nto dose reduction of TAFINLAR were pyrexia (9%), PPES (3%), chills (3%), fatigue (2%),\nand headache (2%).

Because these reactions are reported\nvoluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably\nestimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\nm\na\na\nCardiac: Atrioventricular block complete\nImmune System: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) [see Warnings and\nPrecautions (5.11)]\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue: SCAR (including DRESS and SJS) [see Warnings and\nPrecautions (5.7)]\n7       DRUG INTERACTIONS\n7.1       Effects of Other Drugs on TAFINLAR\nStrong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 may increase the concentration of dabrafenib\n[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Substitution of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or\nCYP2C8 is recommended during treatment with TAFINLAR. If concomitant use of strong\ninhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 is unavoidable, monitor patients closely for adverse\nreactions when taking strong inhibitors.\n7.2       Effects of TAFINLAR on Other Drugs\nDabrafenib decreased the systemic exposures of midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate), S-\nwarfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate), and R-warfarin (a CYP3A4/CYP1A2 substrate) [see\nClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitor international normalized ratio (INR) levels more\nfrequently in patients receiving warfarin during initiation or discontinuation of dabrafenib.\nCoadministration of TAFINLAR with other substrates of these enzymes, including\ndexamethasone or hormonal contraceptives, can result in decreased concentrations\nand loss of efficacy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. Substitute for these\nmedications or monitor patients for loss of efficacy if use of these medications is\nunavoidable.\n8       USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1       Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on findings from animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action [see\nClinical Pharmacology (12.1)], TAFINLAR can cause fetal harm when administered to a\npregnant woman. There is insufficient data in pregnant women exposed to TAFINLAR to\nassess the risks. Dabrafenib was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats at doses three\ntimes greater than the human exposure at the recommended adult clinical dose of 150\nmg twice daily (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nIn a combined female fertility and embryo-fetal development study in rats conducted\nduring the period of organogenesis, developmental toxicity consisted of embryo-\nlethality, ventricular septal defects, and variation in thymic shape at a dabrafenib dose of\n300 mg/kg/day [approximately three times the human exposure at the recommended\nadult dose based on area under the curve (AUC)]. At doses of 20 mg/kg/day or greater\n(equivalent to the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC), rats\ndemonstrated delays in skeletal development and reduced fetal body weight.\n8.2       Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of dabrafenib in human milk, or the effects of\ndabrafenib on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for\nserious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during\ntreatment with TAFINLAR and for 2 weeks following the last dose.\n8.3       Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TAFINLAR.\nContraception\nBased on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action, TAFINLAR can cause\nfetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nFemales\nAdvise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during\ntreatment with TAFINLAR and for 2 weeks after the last dose. Counsel patients to use a\nnon-hormonal method of contraception since TAFINLAR can render hormonal\ncontraceptives ineffective [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].\nMales\nTo avoid potential drug exposure to pregnant partners and female partners of\nreproductive potential, advise male patients (including those who have had vasectomies)\nwith female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with\nTAFINLAR and for 2 weeks after the last dose.\nInfertility\nFemales\nAdvise female patients of reproductive potential that TAFINLAR may impair fertility. A\nreduction in fertility was observed in female rats at dose exposures equivalent to the\nhuman exposure at the recommended adult dose. A reduction in the number of corpora\nlutea was noted in pregnant rats at dose exposures approximately three times the\nhuman exposure at the recommended adult dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\nMales\nAdvise male patients of the potential risk for impaired spermatogenesis which may be\nirreversible. Effects on spermatogenesis have been observed in animals treated with\ndabrafenib at dose exposures up to three times the human exposure at the\nrecommended adult dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n8.4       Pediatric Use\nBRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors and LGG\nThe safety and effectiveness of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib have been\nestablished in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with unresectable or metastatic\nsolid tumors with BRAF V600E mutation who have progressed following prior treatment\nand have no satisfactory alternative treatment options; or with LGG with BRAF V600E\nmutation who require systemic therapy. Use of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib\nfor these indications is supported by evidence from studies X2101 and G2201 that\nenrolled 171 patients (1 to < 18 years) with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced solid\ntumors, of which 4 (2.3%) patients were 1 to < 2 years of age, 39 (23%) patients were\n2 to < 6 years of age, 54 (32%) patients were 6 to < 12 years of age, and 74 (43%)\npatients were 12 to < 18 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical\nPharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)].\nThe safety and effectiveness of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib have not been\nestablished for these indications in pediatric patients less than 1 year old.\nThe safety and effectiveness of TAFINLAR as a single agent in pediatric patients have not\nbeen established.\nJuvenile Animal Toxicity Data\nIn a repeat-dose toxicity study in juvenile rats, an increased incidence of kidney cysts\nand tubular deposits were noted at doses as low as 0.2 times the human exposure at\nthe recommended adult dose based on AUC. Additionally, forestomach hyperplasia,\ndecreased bone length, and early vaginal opening were noted at doses as low as 0.8\ntimes the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC.\n8.5       Geriatric Use\nOf the 586 patients with various solid tumors who received single agent TAFINLAR, 22%\nwere aged 65 years and older. Of the 187 patients with melanoma who received single-\nagent TAFINLAR in the BREAK-3 study, 21% were aged 65 years or older [see Clinical\nStudies (14.1)]. No overall differences in the effectiveness or safety of TAFINLAR were\nobserved between geriatric patients as compared to younger adults in the BREAK-3\nstudy.\nOf the 994 patients with melanoma who received TAFINLAR plus trametinib in the\nCOMBI-d, COMBI-v, and COMBI-AD studies [see Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3)], 21% were\naged 65 years and older and 5% were aged 75 years and older. No overall differences in\nthe effectiveness of TAFINLAR plus trametinib were observed in geriatric patients as\ncompared to younger adults across these melanoma studies. The incidences of\nperipheral edema (26% vs. 12%) and anorexia (21% vs. 9%) were increased in geriatric\npatients as compared to younger adults in these studies.\nOf the 171 patients with NSCLC who received TAFINLAR in Study BRF113928, there\nwere insufficient numbers of geriatric patients to determine whether they respond\ndifferently from younger adults [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].\nOf the 26 patients with ATC who received TAFINLAR in Study BRF117019, 77% were\naged 65 years and older, and 31% were aged 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies\n(14.5)]. This study in ATC did not include sufficient numbers of younger adults to\ndetermine whether they respond differently compared to geriatric patients.\n8.6       Hepatic Impairment\nDose adjustment is not recommended for patients with mild (bilirubin \u2264 upper limit of\nnormal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > ULN or bilirubin > 1x to 1.5x ULN\nand any AST) hepatic impairment. As hepatic metabolism and biliary secretion are the\nprimary routes of elimination of dabrafenib and its metabolites, patients with moderate\n(bilirubin > 1.5x to 3x ULN and any AST) to severe (bilirubin > 3x to 10x ULN and any\nAST) hepatic impairment may have increased exposure. An appropriate dosage has not\nbeen established for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.3)].\n10       OVERDOSAGE\nThere is no information on overdosage of TAFINLAR. Since dabrafenib is highly bound to\nplasma proteins, hemodialysis is likely to be ineffective in the treatment of overdose with\nTAFINLAR.\n11       DESCRIPTION\nDabrafenib mesylate is a kinase inhibitor. The chemical name for dabrafenib mesylate is\nN-{3-[5-(2-amino-4-pyrimidinyl)-2-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1,3-thiazol-4-yl]-2-fluorophenyl}-\n2,6-difluorobenzene sulfonamide, methanesulfonate salt. It has the molecular formula\nC\nH\nF N O S \u2022CH O S and a molecular weight of 615.68 g/mol. Dabrafenib mesylate\nhas the following chemical structure:\nDabrafenib mesylate is a white to slightly colored solid with three pK s: 6.6, 2.2, and -\n1.5. It is very slightly soluble at pH 1 and practically insoluble above pH 4 in aqueous\nmedia.\nTAFINLAR (dabrafenib) capsules for oral use are supplied as 50 mg and 75 mg capsules\nfor oral administration. Each 50 mg capsule contains 59.25 mg dabrafenib mesylate\nequivalent to 50 mg of dabrafenib free base. Each 75 mg capsule contains 88.88 mg\ndabrafenib mesylate equivalent to 75 mg of dabrafenib free base. The inactive\ningredients of TAFINLAR capsules are colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, and\nmicrocrystalline cellulose. Capsule shells contain hypromellose, red iron oxide (E172),\nand titanium dioxide (E171).\nTAFINLAR (dabrafenib) tablets for oral suspension are supplied as 10 mg tablets for oral\nadministration. Each 10 mg tablet contains 11.85 mg dabrafenib mesylate equivalent to\n23\n20 3\n5\n2 2\n4\n3\na\n10 mg of dabrafenib base. The inactive ingredients of TAFINLAR tablets are acesulfame\npotassium, artificial berry flavor, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, hypromellose,\nmagnesium stearate, mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose.\n12       CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1       Mechanism of Action\nDabrafenib is an inhibitor of some mutated forms of BRAF kinases with in vitro IC\nvalues of 0.65, 0.5, and 1.84 nM for BRAF V600E, BRAF V600K, and BRAF V600D\nenzymes, respectively. Dabrafenib also inhibits wild-type BRAF and CRAF kinases with\nIC\n values of 3.2 and 5.0 nM, respectively, and other kinases, such as SIK1, NEK11,\nand LIMK1 at higher concentrations. Some mutations in the BRAF gene, including those\nthat result in BRAF V600E, can result in constitutively activated BRAF kinases that may\nstimulate tumor cell growth [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Dabrafenib inhibits cell\ngrowth of various BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors in vitro and in vivo.\nDabrafenib and trametinib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK\npathway. Use of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination resulted in greater growth\ninhibition of BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumor cell lines in vitro and prolonged inhibition\nof tumor growth in BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumor xenografts compared with\neither drug alone.\nIn the setting of BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer, induction of EGFR-mediated MAPK\npathway re-activation has been identified as a mechanism of intrinsic resistance to BRAF\ninhibitors [see Indications and Usage (1.8)].\n12.2       Pharmacodynamics\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nThe potential effect of TAFINLAR on QT interval was assessed in a dedicated multiple-\ndose study in 32 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors. No large changes\nin the mean QT interval (i.e., > 20 ms) were detected with dabrafenib 300 mg\nadministered twice daily (two times the recommended dosage).\nIn clinical trials, QTc (heart rate-corrected QT) prolongation to \u2265 500 ms occurred in\n0.8% of 264 patients who received TAFINLAR with trametinib and in 1.5% of patients\nwho received TAFINLAR as a single agent. The QTc was increased > 60 ms from\nbaseline in 3.8% of patients who received TAFINLAR with trametinib and 3% of patients\ntreated with TAFINLAR as a single agent.\n12.3       Pharmacokinetics\nFollowing administration of TAFINLAR capsules, dabrafenib C\n and AUC increased in a\ndose-proportional manner across the dose range of 12 mg (0.08 times the approved\nrecommended adult dose) to 300 mg (2 times the approved recommended adult dose),\nbut the increase was less than dose-proportional after steady state twice-daily dosing.\nAfter twice-daily dosing, the mean accumulation ratio was 0.7, and the inter-subject\nvariability (CV%) of AUC at steady-state was 38%.\nAbsorption\n50\n50\nmax\nThe median time to achieve peak plasma concentration (T\n) is 2 hours. Mean absolute\nbioavailability of TAFINLAR capsules is 95% and TAFINLAR tablets for oral suspension is\n76%.\nEffect of Food\nFollowing administration of TAFINLAR capsules, a high-fat meal (approximately 1000\ncalories, 58-75 grams fat, 58 grams carbohydrates, and 33 grams protein) decreased\nC\n by 51%, decreased AUC by 31%, and delayed median T\n by 3.6 hours as\ncompared with the fasted state.\nDistribution\nDabrafenib is 99.7% bound to human plasma proteins. The apparent volume of\ndistribution (V /F) is 70.3 L.\nElimination\nThe mean terminal half-life is 8 hours. Hydroxy-dabrafenib terminal half-life (10 hours)\nparallels that of dabrafenib while the carboxy- and desmethyl-dabrafenib metabolites\nexhibit longer half-lives (21 to 22 hours). The apparent clearance of dabrafenib is 17 L/h\nafter a single dose and 34 L/h after twice-daily dosing for 2 weeks.\nMetabolism\nThe metabolism of dabrafenib is primarily mediated by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 to form\nhydroxy-dabrafenib. Hydroxy-dabrafenib is further oxidized via CYP3A4 to form\ncarboxy-dabrafenib and subsequently excreted in bile and urine. Carboxy-dabrafenib is\ndecarboxylated to form desmethyl-dabrafenib; desmethyl-dabrafenib may be\nreabsorbed from the gut. Desmethyl-dabrafenib is further metabolized by CYP3A4 to\noxidative metabolites. Mean metabolite-to-parent AUC ratios following repeat-dose\nadministration are 0.9, 11, and 0.7 for hydroxy-, carboxy-, and desmethyl-dabrafenib,\nrespectively. Based on systemic exposure, relative potency, and pharmacokinetic\nproperties, both hydroxy- and desmethyl-dabrafenib are likely to contribute to the\nclinical activity of dabrafenib.\nExcretion\nFecal excretion is the major route of elimination accounting for 71% of radioactive dose\nwhile urinary excretion accounted for 23% of total radioactivity as metabolites only.\nSpecific Populations\nAge (18 to 93 years), sex, weight (36 to 170 kg), and renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 89\nmL/min/1.73 m ) have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of\ndabrafenib.\nPediatric Patients\nThe pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib in glioma and other solid tumors were evaluated in\n243 patients aged 1 to < 18 years following a single dose or multiple doses.\nPharmacokinetic parameters in patients aged 1 to < 18 years are within range of values\npreviously observed in adults given the same dose based on weight. Weight (6 to 156\nkg) had a statistically significant effect on dabrafenib oral clearance in this population.\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\nMild hepatic impairment (bilirubin \u2264 ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin > 1x to 1.5x ULN\nmax\nmax\nmax\nc\n2\nand any AST) has no effect on systemic exposure to dabrafenib and its metabolites. No\ndata are available in patients with moderate (bilirubin > 1.5x to 3x ULN and any AST) or\nsevere (bilirubin > 3x to 10x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment.\nDrug Interaction Studies\nEffect of Trametinib on Dabrafenib: Coadministration of TAFINLAR 75 mg twice daily with\ntrametinib 2 mg daily resulted in a 23% increase in AUC of dabrafenib, a 33% increase in\nAUC of desmethyl-dabrafenib, and no change in AUC of hydroxy-dabrafenib as\ncompared with administration of dabrafenib.\nEffect of Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 on Dabrafenib: Coadministration of\nTAFINLAR 75 mg twice daily and ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) for 4 days\nincreased dabrafenib AUC by 71%, hydroxy-dabrafenib AUC by 82%, and desmethyl-\ndabrafenib AUC by 68%.\nCoadministration of TAFINLAR 75 mg twice daily and gemfibrozil (a strong CYP2C8\ninhibitor) for 4 days increased dabrafenib AUC by 47%, with no change in the AUC of\ndabrafenib metabolites.\nEffect of Strong Inducers of CYP3A4 or Moderate Inducers of CYP2C8 on\nDabrafenib: Coadministration of TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily and rifampin (a strong\nCYP3A4 and moderate CYP2C8 inducer) for 10 days decreased dabrafenib AUC by 34%\nand desmethyl-dabrafenib AUC by 30%, and had no effect on hydroxy-dabrafenib AUC.\nEffect of Acid Reducing Agents on Dabrafenib: Coadministration of TAFINLAR 150 mg\ntwice daily and rabeprazole for 4 days did not result in clinically relevant changes in\nexposures to dabrafenib and its metabolites.\nEffect of Dabrafenib on CYP Substrates: Coadministration of TAFINLAR 150 mg twice\ndaily for 15 days and a single dose of midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate) decreased\nmidazolam AUC by 65%. Coadministration of TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily for 15 days\nand a single dose of warfarin decreased the AUC of S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) by\n37% and the AUC of R-warfarin (CYP3A4/CYP1A2 substrate) by 33%.\nIn vitro data demonstrate that dabrafenib is an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 via\nactivation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR)\nnuclear receptors. Dabrafenib may also induce CYP2C enzymes via the same\nmechanism.\nEffect of Transporters on Dabrafenib: Dabrafenib and its metabolites, hydroxyl-\ndabrafenib and desmethyl-dabrafenib, are substrates of human P-glycoprotein (P-gp)\nand breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) but are not substrates of organic cation\ntransporter (OCT1) or organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1A2, OATP1B1,\nOATP1B3, OATP2B1) in vitro.\nEffect of Dabrafenib on Transporters: Coadministration of TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily\nwith a single dose of rosuvastatin (a sensitive OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrate)\nincreased rosuvastatin C\n by 2.6-fold but did not change its AUC.\nDabrafenib and its metabolites, hydroxy-dabrafenib, carboxy-dabrafenib, and\ndesmethyl-dabrafenib, are inhibitors of organic anion transporter (OAT1 and OAT3) in\nvitro. Dabrafenib and desmethyl-dabrafenib are inhibitors of OCT2 and BCRP in vitro.\nmax\n13       NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n13.1       Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies with dabrafenib have not been conducted. TAFINLAR increased\nthe risk of cuSCCs in patients in clinical trials.\nDabrafenib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames\ntest) or the mouse lymphoma assay and was not clastogenic in an in vivo rat bone\nmarrow micronucleus test.\nIn a combined female fertility and embryo-fetal development study in rats, a reduction in\nfertility was noted at doses greater than or equal to 20 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the\nhuman exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC). A reduction in the\nnumber of ovarian corpora lutea was noted in pregnant females at 300 mg/kg/day\n(which is approximately three times the human exposure at the recommended adult\ndose based on AUC).\nMale fertility studies with dabrafenib have not been conducted; however, in repeat-dose\nstudies, testicular degeneration/depletion was seen in rats and dogs at doses equivalent\nto and three times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC,\nrespectively.\n13.2       Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nAdverse cardiovascular effects were noted in dogs at dabrafenib doses of 50 mg/kg/day\n(approximately five times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based\non AUC) or greater, when administered for up to 4 weeks. Adverse effects consisted of\ncoronary arterial degeneration/necrosis and hemorrhage, as well as cardiac\natrioventricular valve hypertrophy/hemorrhage.\n14       CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1       BRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic\nMelanoma \u2013 TAFINLAR As a Single Agent\nBREAK-3 Study\nThe safety and efficacy of TAFINLAR as a single agent were evaluated in an international,\nmulti-center, randomized (3:1), open-label, active-controlled trial (the BREAK-3 study;\nNCT01227889) conducted in 250 patients with previously untreated BRAF V600E\nmutation-positive, unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Patients with any prior use of\nBRAF inhibitors or MEK inhibitors were excluded. Patients were randomized to receive\nTAFINLAR 150 mg orally twice daily (n = 187) or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m  intravenously\nevery 3 weeks (n = 63). Randomization was stratified by disease stage at baseline\n[unresectable Stage III (regional nodal or in-transit metastases), M1a (distant skin,\nsubcutaneous, or nodal metastases), or M1b (lung metastases) versus M1c melanoma\n(all other visceral metastases or elevated serum LDH)]. The main efficacy outcome\nmeasure was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the investigator. In\naddition, an independent radiology review committee (IRRC) assessed the following\nefficacy outcome measures in pre-specified supportive analyses: PFS, confirmed overall\nresponse rate (ORR), and duration of response (DoR).\n2\nThe median age of patients in the BREAK-3 study was 52 years. The majority of the trial\npopulation was male (60%), White (99%), had an ECOG performance status of 0 (67%),\nhad M1c disease (66%), and had normal LDH (62%). All patients had tumor tissue with\nmutations in BRAF V600E as determined by a clinical trial assay at a centralized testing\nsite. Tumor samples from 243 patients (97%) were tested retrospectively using an FDA-\napproved companion diagnostic test, tHxID\u2122-BRAF assay.\nThe median durations of follow-up prior to initiation of alternative treatment in patients\nrandomized to receive TAFINLAR was 5.1 months and in the dacarbazine arm\nwas 3.5 months. Twenty-eight (44%) patients crossed over from the dacarbazine arm at\nthe time of disease progression to receive TAFINLAR.\nThe BREAK-3 study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in progression-free\nsurvival in the patients treated with TAFINLAR.

All patients received TAFINLAR 150\nmg twice daily. Patients in Cohort A (n = 74) had received no prior local therapy for brain\nmetastases, while patients in Cohort B (n = 65) had received at least one local therapy\nfor brain metastases, including, but not limited to, surgical resection, whole brain\nradiotherapy, or stereotactic radiosurgery, such as gamma knife, linear-accelerated-\nbased radiosurgery, or charged particles. In addition, patients in Cohort B were required\nto have evidence of disease progression in a previously treated lesion or an untreated\nlesion. Additional eligibility criteria were at least one measurable lesion of 0.5 cm or\ngreater in largest diameter on contrast-enhanced MRI, stable or decreasing\ncorticosteroid dose, and no more than two prior systemic regimens for treatment of\nmetastatic disease. The major efficacy outcome measure was estimation of the overall\nintracranial response rate (OIRR) in each cohort.\nThe median age of patients in Cohort A was 50 years, 72% were male, 100% were\nWhite, 59% had a pre-treatment ECOG performance status of 0, and 57% had elevated\nLDH at baseline. The median age of patients in Cohort B was 51 years, 63% were male,\n98% were White, 66% had a pre-treatment ECOG performance status of 0, and 54%\nhad elevated LDH at baseline. The intracranial response rate as determined by an\nindependent radiology review committee, masked to investigator response\nassessments, was 18% (95% CI: 10%, 28%) in Cohort A and 18% (95% CI: 10%, 30%)\nin Cohort B. The median duration of intracranial response was 4.6 months in both\ncohorts.\n14.2       BRAF V600E or V600K Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma \u2013\nTAFINLAR With Trametinib\nCOMBI-d Study and COMBI-v Study\nThe safety and efficacy of TAFINLAR administered with trametinib were evaluated in two\ninternational, randomized, active-controlled trials: one double-blind trial (the COMBI-d\nstudy; NCT01584648) and one open-label trial (the COMBI-v study; NCT01597908). \nThe COMBI-d study compared TAFINLAR and trametinib to TAFINLAR and placebo as\nfirst-line therapy for patients with unresectable (Stage IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV)\nBRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma. Patients were\nrandomized (1:1) to receive TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily\nor TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily plus matching placebo. Randomization was stratified by\nLDH level (> ULN vs. \u2264 ULN) and BRAF mutation subtype (V600E vs. V600K). The major\nefficacy outcome was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) per\nRECIST v1.1 with additional efficacy outcome measures of overall survival (OS) and\nconfirmed overall response rate (ORR).\nThe COMBI-v study compared TAFINLAR and trametinib to vemurafenib as first-line\ntreatment therapy for patients with unresectable (Stage IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV)\nBRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma. Patients were\nrandomized (1:1) to receive TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily\nor vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily. Randomization was stratified by lactate\ndehydrogenase (LDH) level (> ULN vs. \u2264 ULN) and BRAF mutation subtype (V600E vs.\nV600K). The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival. Additional efficacy\noutcome measures were PFS and ORR as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1.\nIn the COMBI-d study, 423 patients were randomized to TAFINLAR plus trametinib\n(n = 211) or TAFINLAR plus placebo (n = 212). The median age was 56 years (range: 22\nto 89), 53% were male, > 99% were White, 72% had ECOG performance status of 0,\n4% had Stage IIIC, 66% had M1c disease, 65% had normal LDH, and 2 patients had a\nhistory of brain metastases. All patients had tumor containing BRAF V600E or V600K\nmutations as determined by centralized testing with the FDA-approved companion\ndiagnostic test; 85% with BRAF V600E mutations and 15% with BRAF V600K mutations.\nIn the COMBI-v study, 704 patients were randomized to TAFINLAR plus trametinib (n =\n352) or single-agent vemurafenib (n = 352). The median age was 55 years (range: 18 to\n91), 96% were White, 55% were male, 6% had Stage IIIC, 61% had M1c disease, 67%\nhad normal LDH, 70% had ECOG performance status of 0, 89% had BRAF V600E\nmutation-positive melanoma, and one patient had a history of brain metastases.\nThe COMBI-d and COMBI-v studies demonstrated statistically significant improvements\nin OS and PFS.

Kaplan-Meier Curves for Overall Survival in the COMBI-v Study\nCOMBI-MB Study\nThe activity of TAFINLAR with trametinib for the treatment of BRAF V600E or V600K\nmutation-positive melanoma, metastatic to the brain, was evaluated in a non-\nrandomized, open-label, multi-center, multi-cohort trial (the COMBI-MB study;\nNCT02039947). Eligible patients were required to have at least one measurable\nintracranial lesion and to have no leptomeningeal disease, parenchymal brain metastasis\ngreater than 4 cm in diameter, ocular melanoma, or primary mucosal melanoma.\nPatients received TAFINLAR 150 mg orally twice daily and trametinib 2 mg orally once\ndaily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome\nmeasure was intracranial response rate, defined as the percentage of patients with a\nconfirmed intracranial response per RECIST v1.1, modified to allow up to five intracranial\ntarget lesions at least 5 mm in diameter, as assessed by independent review.\nThe COMBI-MB study enrolled 121 patients with a BRAF V600E (85%) or V600K (15%)\nmutation. The median age was 54 years (range: 23 to 84), 58% were male, 100% were\nWhite, 8% were from the United States, 65% had normal LDH at baseline, and 97% had\nan ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Intracranial metastases were asymptomatic in\n87% and symptomatic in 13% of patients, 22% received prior local therapy for brain\nmetastases, and 87% also had extracranial metastases.\nThe intracranial response rate was 50% (95% CI: 41, 60), with a complete response rate\nof 4.1% and a partial response rate of 46%. The median duration of intracranial\nresponse was 6.4 months (range: 1 to 31). Of the patients with an intracranial\nresponse, 9% had stable or progressive disease as their best overall response.\n14.3       Adjuvant Treatment of BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive\nMelanoma\nCOMBI-AD (NCT 01682083) was an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind,\nplacebo-controlled trial that enrolled patients with Stage III melanoma with BRAF V600E\nor V600K mutations as detected by the tHxID -BRAF assay and pathologic involvement\nof regional lymph node(s). Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive TAFINLAR 150 mg\ntwice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily or two placebos for up to 1 year. Enrollment\nrequired complete resection of melanoma with complete lymphadenectomy within 12\nweeks prior to randomization. The trial excluded patients with mucosal or ocular\nmelanoma, unresectable in-transit metastases, distant metastatic disease, or prior\nsystemic anti-cancer treatment, including radiotherapy. Randomization was stratified by\nBRAF mutation status (V600E or V600K) and American Joint Committee on Cancer\n(AJCC; 7\n Edition) Stage (IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC). The major efficacy outcome measure was\nrelapse-free survival (RFS), defined as the time from randomization to disease\nrecurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis), new primary melanoma, or death\nfrom any cause, whichever occurred first as assessed by the investigator. Patients\nunderwent imaging for tumor recurrence every 3 months for the first two years and\nevery 6 months thereafter.\nIn COMBI-AD, a total of 870 patients were randomized: 438 to TAFINLAR administered\nwith trametinib and 432 to placebo. Median age was 51 years (range: 18 to 89), 55%\nwere male, 99% were White, and 91% had an ECOG performance status of 0. Disease\ncharacteristics were AJCC Stage IIIA (18%), Stage IIIB (41%), Stage IIIC (40%), stage\nunknown (1%); BRAF V600E mutation (91%), BRAF V600K mutation (9%); macroscopic\nlymph nodes (65%); and tumor ulceration (41%). The median duration of follow-up (time\nfrom randomization to last contact or death) was 2.8 years.\nCOMBI-AD showed a statistically significant improvement in RFS in patients randomized\nto TAFINLAR administered with trametinib compared to those randomized to placebo.\nEfficacy results are presented in Table 22 and Figure 4.\nTable 22.

Key eligibility criteria were locally confirmed\nBRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC, no prior exposure to BRAF or MEK-\ninhibitor, and absence of EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement (unless patients had\nprogression on prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy). Patients enrolled in Cohorts A\nand B were required to have received at least one previous platinum-based\nchemotherapy regimen for NSCLC with demonstrated disease progression but no more\nthan three prior systemic regimens. Patients enrolled in Cohort C could not have\nreceived prior systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC. Patients in Cohort A received\nTAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily. Patients in Cohorts B and C received TAFINLAR 150 mg\ntwice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily.

Patients with LGG (WHO grades 1 and 2) who\nrequired first systemic therapy were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to dabrafenib plus\ntrametinib (D + T) or carboplatin plus vincristine (C + V).\nBRAF mutation status was identified prospectively via a local assessment or a central\nlaboratory test. In addition, retrospective testing of available tumor samples by the\ncentral laboratory was performed to evaluate BRAF V600E mutation status.\nPatients received age- and weight-based dosing of TAFINLAR and trametinib until loss of\nclinical benefit or until unacceptable toxicity. Carboplatin and vincristine were dosed\nbased on body surface area at doses 175 mg/m  and 1.5 mg/m  (0.05 mg/kg for\npatients < 12 kg), respectively, as one 10-week induction course followed by eight 6-\nweek cycles of maintenance therapy.\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) by independent\nreview based on RANO LGG (2017) criteria. Additional efficacy outcome measures were\nprogression-free survival and overall survival. The primary analysis was performed when\nall patients had completed at least 32 weeks of therapy.\nIn the LGG cohort, 110 patients were randomized to D + T (n = 73) or C + V (n = 37).\nMedian age was 9.5 years (range: 1 to 17); 60% were female.

Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting,\nor abdominal pain occurred in 95% of 925 patients, including severe cases (Grade 3 or\n4) in 14% of patients treated with ZYKADIA across clinical studies. Diarrhea, nausea,\nvomiting, or abdominal pain leading to dose interruptions or reductions occurred in 36%\nof patients and leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 1.6% of patients.\nThe incidence and severity of gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reduced for\npatients treated with ZYKADIA 450 mg with food in a dose optimization study (ASCEND-\n8). Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain occurred in 79% of 108 patients\ntreated with ZYKADIA at the recommended dose of 450 mg with food. Of these, 53%\nwere Grade 1 events and 24% were Grade 2 events. One patient (0.9%) experienced\nGrade 3 diarrhea, and one patient (0.9%) experienced Grade 3 vomiting. One patient\n(0.9%) required dose adjustment due to vomiting. Eleven (10%) patients had diarrhea,\nnausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain that required at least one dose interruption.\nMonitor and manage patients using standard of care, including antidiarrheals,\nantiemetics, or fluid replacement, as indicated. Withhold ZYKADIA if gastrointestinal\nadverse reaction is severe or intolerable and is not responsive to antiemetics or\nantidiarrheals. Upon improvement, resume ZYKADIA at a reduced dose [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3)].\n5.2       Hepatotoxicity\nDrug-induced hepatotoxicity occurred in patients treated with ZYKADIA [see Adverse\nReactions (6.1)]. Elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 5 times the upper limit\nof normal (ULN) occurred in 28% and elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >\n5 times ULN occurred in 16% of 925 patients across clinical studies. Concurrent\nelevations in ALT > 3 times the ULN and total bilirubin > 2 times the ULN, with alkaline\nphosphatase < 2 times the ULN occurred in 0.3% of patients across clinical studies.\nApproximately 1% of patients required permanent discontinuation due to hepatotoxicity.\nMonitor with liver laboratory tests, including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin, once a month\nand as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop\ntransaminase elevations. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold\nZYKADIA with resumption at a reduced dose, or permanently discontinue ZYKADIA [see\nDosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.3       Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis\nSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung diseases (ILD)/pneumonitis occurred in\npatients treated with ZYKADIA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Across clinical studies,\nILD/pneumonitis was reported in 2.4% of 925 patients treated with ZYKADIA. Grade 3 or\n4 ILD/pneumonitis was reported in 1.3% of patients, with fatal events reported in 0.2%\nof patients. Ten patients (1.1%) discontinued ZYKADIA across clinical studies due to\nILD/pneumonitis.\nMonitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Exclude other\npotential causes of ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue ZYKADIA in patients\ndiagnosed with treatment-related ILD/pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration\n(2.3)].\n5.4       QT Interval Prolongation\nQTc interval prolongation, which may lead to an increased risk for ventricular\ntachyarrhythmia (e.g., torsades de pointes) or sudden death, occurred in patients\ntreated with ZYKADIA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Across clinical studies, 6% of 919\npatients with at least one post-baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment had an\nincrease from baseline of QTc > 60 msec. Approximately 1.3% of patients taking\nZYKADIA 750 mg under fasted conditions were found to have a QTc > 500 msec.\nZYKADIA causes concentration-dependent increases in the QTc interval [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.2)]. Across clinical studies, 0.2% of patients discontinued ZYKADIA\ndue to QTc prolongation.\nWhen possible, avoid use of ZYKADIA in patients with congenital long QT syndrome.\nConduct periodic monitoring with ECGs and electrolytes in patients with congestive heart\nfailure, bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, or those who are taking medications\nthat are known to prolong the QTc interval. Based on the severity of the adverse\nreaction, withhold ZYKADIA, with resumption at a reduced dose, or permanently\ndiscontinue ZYKADIA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n5.5       Hyperglycemia\nHyperglycemia occurred in patients treated with ZYKADIA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nAcross clinical studies, Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia, based on laboratory values,\noccurred in 13% of 925 patients.\nMonitor fasting serum glucose prior to the start of ZYKADIA treatment and periodically\nthereafter as clinically indicated. Initiate or optimize anti-hyperglycemic medications as\nindicated. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold ZYKADIA with\nresumption at a reduced dose, or permanently discontinue ZYKADIA [see Dosage and\nAdministration (2.3)].\n5.6       Bradycardia\nBradycardia occurred in patients treated with ZYKADIA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nAcross clinical studies, sinus bradycardia, defined as a heart rate < 50 beats per minute,\nwas noted as a new finding in 1.1% of 925 patients. Bradycardia was reported as an\nadverse reaction in 1% of patients. No patient required discontinuation and 0.1%\nrequired interruption with subsequent dose reduction for bradycardia.\nAvoid using ZYKADIA in combination with other products known to cause bradycardia\n(e.g., beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, clonidine, and\ndigoxin) to the extent possible. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. Based\non the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold ZYKADIA with resumption at a reduced\ndose upon resolution of bradycardia, or permanently discontinue ZYKADIA [see Dosage\nand Administration (2.3)].\n5.7       Pancreatitis\nPancreatitis occurred in patients treated with ZYKADIA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nPancreatitis, including one fatality, occurred in less than 1% of patients receiving\nZYKADIA in clinical studies. Grade 3 or 4 elevations of amylase occurred in 7% of\npatients receiving ZYKADIA across clinical studies, while Grade 3 or 4 elevations of lipase\noccurred in 14% of patients.\nMonitor lipase and amylase prior to the start of ZYKADIA treatment and periodically\nthereafter as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of the laboratory abnormalities,\nwithhold ZYKADIA with resumption at a reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration\n(2.3)].\n5.8       Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\nBased on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, ZYKADIA can cause\nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, administration of\nceritinib to rats and rabbits during organogenesis at maternal plasma exposures below\nthe recommended human dose caused increases in skeletal anomalies in rats and\nrabbits.\nAdvise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive\npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ZYKADIA and for 6\nmonths following completion of therapy. Based on the potential for genotoxicity, advise\nmales with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment\nwith ZYKADIA and for 3 months following completion of therapy [see Use in Specific\nPopulations (8.1, 8.3), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n6       ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the\nlabeling:\nGastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \nHepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \nInterstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \nQT Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] \nHyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] \nBradycardia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] \nPancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]\n6.1       Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe data in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to ZYKADIA 750 mg\nonce daily under fasted conditions in 925 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC across seven\nclinical studies, including ASCEND-4 and ASCEND-1, described below, a randomized\nactive-controlled study, two single arm studies, and two dose-escalation studies. The\nmajority of patients enrolled in these studies had received prior treatment with\nchemotherapy and/or crizotinib for NSCLC. Among these 925 patients, the most\ncommon adverse reactions (\u2265 25% incidence) were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue,\nabdominal pain, decreased appetite, and weight loss. Approximately 45% of patients\ninitiating treatment with ZYKADIA 750 mg under fasted conditions had an adverse\nreaction that required at least one dose reduction and 66% of patients had an adverse\nreaction that required at least one dose interruption. The median time to first dose\nreduction due to any reason was 7 weeks.\nDose Optimization Study: Dosing Regimen of 450 mg Daily With Food\nIn ASCEND-8, a dose optimization study, ZYKADIA 450 mg daily with food (N = 108)\nwas compared to 750 mg daily under fasted conditions (N = 110) in both previously\ntreated and untreated patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. The overall safety profile of\nZYKADIA 450 mg with food was consistent with ZYKADIA 750 mg fasted, except for a\nreduction in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, while achieving comparable steady-state\nexposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265\n25% incidence) in the 450 mg with food arm were diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain,\nvomiting, and fatigue. The incidence and severity of gastrointestinal adverse reactions\n(diarrhea 59%, nausea 43%, and vomiting 38%) were reduced for patients treated with\nZYKADIA 450 mg with food; Grade \u2265 3 adverse reactions were reported in two patients\n(1.9%): Grade 3 diarrhea and Grade 3 vomiting in one patient each [see Warnings and\nPrecautions (5.1)].\nIn patients treated with ZYKADIA 450 mg with food, 24% of patients had an adverse\nreaction that required at least one dose reduction and 56% of patients had an adverse\nreaction that required at least one dose interruption. The median time to first dose\nreduction due to any reason was 8 weeks.\nPreviously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC\nThe safety of ZYKADIA was evaluated in ASCEND-4, an open-label, randomized, active-\ncontrolled multicenter study of 376 previously untreated ALK-positive NSCLC patients\n[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients received ZYKADIA 750 mg daily (N = 189) under\nfasted conditions or chemotherapy and maintenance chemotherapy (N = 187).\nChemotherapy regimens were pemetrexed (500 mg/m ) and investigator\u2019s choice of\ncisplatin (75 mg/m ) or carboplatin [area under the curve (AUC) of 5 - 6 mg*min/mL]\nadministered every 21 days. Patients who completed 4 cycles of chemotherapy without\nprogressive disease received pemetrexed (500 mg/m ) as single-agent maintenance\ntherapy every 21 days. The median duration of exposure to ZYKADIA was 18 months.\nThe demographic characteristics of the study population were 57% female, median age\n54 years (range, 22 to 81 years), 22% age 65 years or older, 54% white, 42% Asian, 2%\nblack, and 2% other races. Patients were enrolled in Europe (53%), Asia Pacific (42%),\nand South America (5%) regions. The majority of patients had adenocarcinoma (97%),\nnever smoked (61%), and 32% had brain metastases at screening.\nThe following fatal adverse reactions occurred in 4 patients treated with ZYKADIA:\nMyocardial infarction, respiratory tract infection, pneumonitis, and unknown cause.\nSerious adverse reactions were reported in 38% of patients treated with ZYKADIA. The\nmost frequent serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (4%), pleural effusion (4%),\nvomiting (4%), nausea (3%), dyspnea (3%), hyperglycemia (3%), AST increased (2%),\nlung infection (2%), and pericardial effusion (2%).\nAmong patients treated with ZYKADIA, dose interruptions due to adverse reactions\noccurred in 77%, dose reductions were required in 66%, and adverse reactions that led\nto discontinuation of therapy occurred in 12% of patients. The most frequent adverse\n2\n2\n2\nreactions, reported in at least 10% of patients treated with ZYKADIA, that led to dose\ninterruptions or reductions were: Increased ALT (48%), increased AST (34%), vomiting\n(15%), increased blood creatinine (14%), increased gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase\n(GGT) (13%), diarrhea (13%), and nausea (13%).

Avoid concurrent use of strong CYP3A\ninhibitors during treatment with ZYKADIA. If concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors\nis unavoidable, reduce the ZYKADIA dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\nDo not consume grapefruit and grapefruit juice as they may inhibit CYP3A.\nStrong CYP3A Inducers\nA strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducer (rifampin) decreased the systemic exposure of ceritinib\n[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may decrease the efficacy of ZYKADIA. Avoid\nconcurrent use of strong CYP3A inducers during treatment with ZYKADIA.\n7.2       Effect of ZYKADIA on Other Drugs\nCYP3A Substrates\nCeritinib increased the systemic exposure of a sensitive CYP3A substrate (midazolam)\n[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid coadministration of ZYKADIA with sensitive\nCYP3A substrates. If concomitant use is unavoidable, consider dose reduction of the\nsensitive CYP3A substrate(s). If ZYKADIA is coadministered with other CYP3A\nsubstrates, refer to the CYP3A substrate labeling for dosage recommendation with\nstrong CYP3A inhibitors.\nCYP2C9 Substrates\nCeritinib increased the systemic exposure of a CYP2C9 substrate (warfarin) [see Clinical\nPharmacology (12.3)]. Increase the frequency of INR monitoring if coadministration with\nwarfarin is unavoidable as the anti-coagulant effect of warfarin may be enhanced.\nAvoid coadministration of ZYKADIA with CYP2C9 substrates for which minimal\nconcentration changes may lead to serious toxicities. If concomitant use of such\nCYP2C9 substrates is unavoidable, consider dose reduction for the coadministered\nCYP2C9 substrates.\n7.3       Drugs That Prolong QT Interval\nZYKADIA causes concentration-dependent increases in the QTc interval. When possible,\navoid coadministration of ZYKADIA with other products with a known potential to\nprolong the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Pharmacology\n(12.2)].\n7.4       Drugs That Cause Bradycardia\nZYKADIA can cause bradycardia. When possible, avoid coadministration of ZYKADIA\nwith other products known to cause bradycardia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6),\nClinical Pharmacology (12.2)].\n8       USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1       Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nBased on animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)],\nZYKADIA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The limited\navailable data on the use of ZYKADIA in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a risk.\nAdministration of ceritinib to rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at\nmaternal plasma exposures below the recommended human dose caused increases in\nskeletal anomalies in rats and rabbits (see Data). Advise a pregnant woman of the\npotential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,\nrespectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nIn an embryo-fetal development study in which pregnant rats were administered daily\ndoses of ceritinib during organogenesis, dose-related skeletal anomalies were observed\nat doses as low as 50 mg/kg (less than 0.5-fold the human exposure by AUC at the\nrecommended dose). Findings included delayed ossifications and skeletal variations.\nIn pregnant rabbits administered ceritinib daily during organogenesis, dose-related\nskeletal anomalies, including incomplete ossification, were observed at doses equal to or\n> 2 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.015-fold the human exposure by AUC at the\nrecommended dose). A low incidence of visceral anomalies, including absent or\nmalpositioned gallbladder and retroesophageal subclavian cardiac artery, was observed\nat doses equal to or > 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.13-fold the human exposure by\nAUC at the recommended dose). Maternal toxicity and abortion occurred in rabbits at\ndoses of 35 mg/kg or greater. In addition, embryolethality was observed in rabbits at a\ndose of 50 mg/kg.\n8.2       Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data regarding the presence of ceritinib or its metabolites in human milk,\nthe effects of ceritinib on the breastfed child or its effects on milk production. Because\nof the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to\nbreastfeed during treatment with ZYKADIA and for 2 weeks following completion of\ntherapy.\n8.3       Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\nPregnancy Testing\nVerify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating ZYKADIA\n[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nContraception\nZYKADIA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in\nSpecific Populations (8.1)].\nFemales\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment\nwith ZYKADIA and for 6 months following completion of therapy.\nMales\nBased on the potential for genotoxicity, advise males with female partners of\nreproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with ZYKADIA and for 3\nmonths following completion of therapy [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n8.4       Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of ZYKADIA in pediatric patients have not been established.\n8.5       Geriatric Use\nOf the 925 patients in clinical studies of ZYKADIA, 18% were 65 years or older, while 5%\nwere 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed\nbetween these subjects and younger subjects.\n8.6       Hepatic Impairment\nFor patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), reduce the dose of ZYKADIA\n[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients\nwith mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment.\n11       DESCRIPTION\nCeritinib is a kinase inhibitor for oral administration. The molecular formula for ceritinib is\nC\nH\nN O ClS. The molecular weight is 558.14 g/mol. Ceritinib is described chemically\nas 5-Chloro-N4-[2-[(1-methylethyl)sulfonyl]phenyl]-N2-[5-methyl-2-(1-methylethoxy)-4-\n(4-piperidinyl)phenyl]-2,4-pyrimidinediamine.\nThe chemical structure of ceritinib is shown below:\nCeritinib is a white to almost white or light yellow powder.\nZYKADIA is supplied as printed hard-gelatin capsules containing 150 mg of ceritinib and\n28\n36\n5\n3\nthe following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, hard gelatin capsule shells, low\nsubstituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and\nsodium starch glycolate. The capsule shell is composed of FD&C Blue # 2, gelatin, and\ntitanium dioxide.\nZYKADIA is supplied as film-coated tablets containing 150 mg of ceritinib and the\nfollowing inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, low-\nsubstituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose and\npovidone. The tablet coating contains FD&C Blue # 2 aluminum lake, hypromellose,\npolyethylene glycol 4000, talc, and titanium dioxide.\n12       CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1       Mechanism of Action\nCeritinib is a kinase inhibitor. Targets of ceritinib inhibition identified in either biochemical\nor cellular assays at clinically relevant concentrations include ALK, insulin-like growth\nfactor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), insulin receptor (InsR), and ROS1. Among these, ceritinib is\nmost active against ALK. Ceritinib inhibited autophosphorylation of ALK, ALK-mediated\nphosphorylation of the downstream signaling protein STAT3, and proliferation of ALK-\ndependent cancer cells in in vitro and in vivo assays.\nCeritinib inhibited the in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing EML4-ALK and NPM-ALK\nfusion proteins and demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of EML4-ALK-positive\nNSCLC xenograft growth in mice and rats. Ceritinib exhibited dose-dependent anti-tumor\nactivity in mice bearing EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC xenografts with demonstrated\nresistance to crizotinib, at concentrations within a clinically relevant range. \n12.2       Pharmacodynamics\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nTwelve of 919 patients (1.3%) treated with ZYKADIA 750 mg once daily under fasted\nconditions with at least one post-baseline ECG assessment were found to have a QTc >\n500 msec and 58 patients (6%) had an increase from baseline QTc > 60 msec. In\nASCEND-4, a central tendency analysis of the QTc data at average steady-state\nconcentrations demonstrated that the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for QTc was\n15.3 msec at ZYKADIA 750 mg once daily under fasted conditions. A\npharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis suggested concentration-dependent QTc\ninterval prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].\nTen of 925 patients (1.1%) had bradycardia defined as < 50 beats per minute [see\nWarnings and Precautions (5.6)].\n12.3       Pharmacokinetics\nAfter a single oral administration of ZYKADIA in patients, AUC and C\n increased dose\nproportionally over 50 mg to 750 mg under fasted conditions.\nFollowing ZYKADIA 750 mg once daily under fasted conditions, steady state was\nreached by 15 days with a geometric mean accumulation ratio of 6.2 after 3 weeks.\nSystemic exposure increased in a greater than dose proportional manner after repeat\ndoses of 50 mg to 750 mg once daily under fasted conditions.\nmax\nAbsorption\nAfter a single oral administration of ZYKADIA in patients, peak plasma levels (C\n) of\nceritinib were achieved around 4 to 6 hours.\nFood Effect\nA food effect study conducted in healthy subjects with a single 500 mg dose of\nZYKADIA capsules showed that a high-fat meal (containing approximately 1000 calories\nand 58 grams of fat) increased ceritinib AUC by 73% and C\n by 41% and a low-fat\nmeal (containing approximately 330 calories and 9 grams of fat) increased ceritinib AUC\nby 58% and C\n by 43% as compared with the fasted conditions.\nA food effect study conducted in healthy subjects with a single 750 mg dose of\nZYKADIA tablets showed that a high-fat meal (containing approximately 1000 calories\nand 58 grams of fat) increased ceritinib AUC by 64% and C\n by 58% and a low-fat\nmeal (containing approximately 330 calories and 9 grams of fat) increased ceritinib AUC\nby 39% and C\n by 42% as compared with the fasted conditions.\nDose Optimization Study: Dosing Regimen of 450 mg Daily With Food\nIn a dose optimization study (ASCEND-8) in patients receiving 450 mg dose of ZYKADIA\ncapsules daily with food (approximately 100 to 500 calories and 1.5 to 15 grams of fat)\nor 750 mg daily under fasted conditions, there was no clinically meaningful difference in\nthe systemic steady-state exposure of ceritinib (AUC) between the 450 mg with food\narm and the 750 mg fasted arm.\nDistribution\nCeritinib is 97% bound to human plasma proteins, independent of drug concentration.\nThe geometric mean apparent volume of distribution (V /F) is 4230 L following a single\n750 mg ZYKADIA dose under fasted conditions in patients. Ceritinib also has a slight\npreferential distribution to red blood cells, relative to plasma, with a mean in vitro blood-\nto-plasma ratio of 1.35.\nElimination\nFollowing a single 750 mg ZYKADIA dose under fasted conditions, the geometric mean\napparent plasma terminal half-life (t\n) of ceritinib was 41 hours in patients. Ceritinib\ndemonstrates nonlinear PK over time. The geometric mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of\nceritinib was lower at steady state (33.2 L/h) after 750 mg daily dosing than after a\nsingle 750 mg dose (88.5 L/h).\nMetabolism: In vitro studies demonstrated that CYP3A was the major enzyme involved in\nthe metabolic clearance of ceritinib. Following oral administration of a single 750 mg\nradiolabeled dose under fasted conditions, ceritinib was the main circulating component\n(82%) in human plasma.\nExcretion: Following oral administration of a single 750 mg radiolabeled dose under\nfasted conditions, 92% of the administered dose was recovered in the feces (with 68%\nas unchanged parent compound) while 1.3% of the administered dose was recovered in\nthe urine.\nSpecific Populations\nAge, sex, race, body weight, and mild-to-moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to < 90\nmax\nmax\nmax\nmax\nmax\nd\n1/2\nmL/min estimated with Cockcroft-Gault) has no clinically important effect on the\nsystemic exposure of ceritinib based on population pharmacokinetic analyses. Patients\nwith severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) were not included in the clinical trial.\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment: Following a single 750 mg ZYKADIA dose under fasted\nconditions, the geometric mean systemic exposure (AUC\n) of ceritinib was increased\nby 66% and unbound ceritinib AUC\n was increased by 108% in subjects with severe\n(Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function\n[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Total and unbound systemic exposure of ceritinib\nwere similar in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic\nimpairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.\nDrug Interaction Studies\nEffect of Strong CYP3A/P-gp Inhibitors on Ceritinib: Coadministration of a single 450 mg\nZYKADIA dose under fasted conditions with ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A/P-gp\ninhibitor) for 14 days increased ceritinib AUC by 2.9-fold and C\n by 22%. The steady-\nstate AUC of ceritinib at a dose of 450 mg once daily under fasted conditions with\nketoconazole for 14 days was predicted to be similar to the steady-state AUC of ceritinib\nat a dose of 750 mg alone under fasted conditions.\nEffect of Strong CYP3A/P-gp Inducers on Ceritinib: Coadministration of a single 750 mg\nZYKADIA dose under fasted conditions with rifampin (a strong CYP3A/P-gp inducer) for\n14 days decreased ceritinib AUC by 70% and C\n by 44%.\nEffect of Ceritinib on CYP3A Substrates: Coadministration of a single dose of midazolam\n(a sensitive CYP3A substrate) following 3 weeks of ZYKADIA (750 mg daily under fasted\nconditions) increased the midazolam AUC by 5.4-fold and C\n by 1.8-fold compared to\nmidazolam administered alone [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].\nEffect of Ceritinib on CYP2C9 Substrates: Coadministration of a single dose of warfarin\n(a CYP2C9 substrate) following 3 weeks of ZYKADIA (750 mg daily under fasted\nconditions) increased the S-warfarin AUC by 54% with no change in C\n compared to\nwarfarin administered alone [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].\nEffect of Acid Reducing Agents on Ceritinib: Coadministration of a single 750 mg\nZYKADIA dose under fasted conditions with a proton pump inhibitor (esomeprazole) for\n6 days in healthy subjects decreased ceritinib AUC by 76% and C\n by 79%; however,\ncoadministration of a single 750 mg ZYKADIA dose under fasted conditions with proton\npump inhibitors for 6 days in a subgroup of patients from ASCEND-1 suggested less\neffect on ceritinib exposure than that observed in healthy subjects as AUC decreased by\n30% and C\n decreased by 25% and no clinically meaningful effect on ceritinib\nexposure was observed at steady-state.\nEffect of Transporters on Ceritinib Disposition: Ceritinib is a substrate of efflux\ntransporter P-gp, but is not a substrate of BCRP, MRP2, OCT1, OAT2, or OATP1B1 in\nvitro.\nEffect of Ceritinib on Transporters: Based on in vitro data, ceritinib is unlikely to inhibit P-\ngp, BCRP, MRP2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, or OCT2 at clinical\nconcentrations.\n13       NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n0-INF\n0-INF\nmax\nmax\nmax\nmax\nmax\nmax\n13.1       Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed with ceritinib.\nCeritinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay but\ninduced numerical aberrations (aneugenic) in the in vitro cytogenetic assay using human\nlymphocytes, and micronuclei in the in vitro micronucleus test using TK6 cells. Ceritinib\nwas not clastogenic in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay.\nThere are no data on the effect of ceritinib on human fertility. Fertility/early embryonic\ndevelopment studies were not conducted with ceritinib. There were no adverse effects\non male or female reproductive organs in general toxicology studies conducted in\nmonkeys and rats at exposures \u2265 0.5- and 1.5-fold, respectively, of the human\nexposure by AUC at the recommended dose.\n13.2       Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nTarget organs in nonclinical animal models included, but were not limited to, the\npancreas, biliopancreatic/bile ducts, gastrointestinal tract, and liver. Pancreatic focal\nacinar cell atrophy was observed in rats at 1.5-fold the human exposure by AUC at the\nrecommended dose. Biliopancreatic duct and bile duct necrosis was observed in rats at\nexposures \u2265 5% of the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. Bile duct\ninflammation and vacuolation were also noted in monkeys at exposures \u2265 0.5-fold the\nhuman exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. Frequent minimal necrosis and\nhemorrhage of the duodenum was exhibited in monkeys at 0.5-fold the human\nexposure by AUC, and in rats at an exposure similar to that observed clinically.\nCeritinib crossed the blood brain barrier in rats with a brain-to-blood exposure (AUC\n)\nratio of approximately 15%.\n14       CLINICAL STUDIES\n14.1       Previously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC\nThe efficacy of ZYKADIA for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who had\nnot received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease was evaluated in an open-\nlabel, randomized, active-controlled, multicenter study (ASCEND-4, NCT01828099).\nPatients were required to have World Health Organization (WHO) performance status 0-\n2 and ALK-positive NSCLC as identified by the VENTANA ALK (D5F3) CDx Assay.\nNeurologically stable patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases that did not\nrequire increasing doses of steroids to manage CNS symptoms were permitted to enroll.\nPatients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus; a history of ILD or interstitial pneumonitis;\nor a history of pancreatitis, or increased amylase, or lipase that was due to pancreatic\ndisease were not eligible.\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) as determined\nby Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) according to RECIST v1.1. Additional\nefficacy outcome measures were overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR) and\nduration of response (DOR) determined by BIRC, overall intracranial response rate\n(OIRR), duration of intracranial response (DOIR) determined by BIRC neuro-radiologist,\nand patient reported outcomes.\nPatients were randomized 1:1 to receive ZYKADIA 750 mg orally daily under fasted\ninf\nconditions or chemotherapy and maintenance chemotherapy. Randomization was\nstratified by WHO performance status, prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy and\npresence or absence of brain metastases. Patients randomized to chemotherapy\nreceived pemetrexed (500 mg/m ) and investigator\u2019s choice of cisplatin (75 mg/m ) or\ncarboplatin (AUC of 5 - 6 mg*min/mL) administered on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for a\nmaximum of 4 cycles followed by pemetrexed (500 mg/m ) every 21 days. Treatment in\nboth arms was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\nThe study population characteristics were: 57% female, median age 54 years (range, 22\nto 81 years), 22% age 65 years or older, 54% white, 42% Asian, 2% black, and 2% other\nraces. The majority of patients had adenocarcinoma (97%) and never smoked (61%).\nCNS metastases were present in 32% (n = 121) of patients. Approximately half (n = 55)\nhad measurable CNS metastases as determined by BIRC neuro-radiologist and 71% (n =\n39) of these patients received no prior intracranial radiotherapy. Of those randomized to\nchemotherapy, 43% received ZYKADIA as the next antineoplastic therapy after platinum-\nbased chemotherapy.\nEfficacy results from ASCEND-4 are summarized in Table 7 and Figure 1.\nTable 7: Efficacy Results by BIRC Assessment in ASCEND-4\nEfficacy Parameter\nZYKADIA \n(N = 189)\nChemotherapy \n(N = 187)\nProgression-Free Survival\n          Number of events, n (%)\n89 (47%)\n113 (60%)\n                Progressive disease, n\n(%)\n79 (42%)\n105 (56%)\n                Death, n (%)\n10 (5%)\n8 (4%)\n          Median PFS in months (95%\nCI)\n16.6 (12.6, 27.2)\n8.1 (5.8, 11.1)\n          Hazard ratio (95% CI)\n0.55 (0.42, 0.73)\n          P-value\n< 0.0001\nOverall Response Rate\n          Overall response rate, %\n(95% CI)\n73 (66, 79)\n27 (21, 34)\n          Complete response, %\n1\n0\n          Partial response, %\n72\n27\nDuration of Response\n          Number of responders\nn = 137\nn = 50\n          Median in months (95% CI)\n23.9 (16.6, NE)\n11.1 (7.8, 16.4)\nAbbreviations: BIRC, Blinded Independent Review Committee; CI, confidence interval;\nNE, not estimable.\nCox proportional hazards model stratified by brain metastases (absence vs.\npresence), WHO performance status (0 vs. \u2265 1), and prior adjuvant chemotherapy\n(absence vs. presence).\nLog-rank test stratified by brain metastases (absence vs. presence), WHO\nperformance status (0 vs. \u2265 1), and prior adjuvant chemotherapy (absence vs.\npresence).\nClopper and Pearson exact binomial 95% CI.\n2\n2\n2\na\nb\nc \na\nb\nc\nThere was no significant difference in OS in a pre-specified interim analysis conducted at\n42% of the events required for the final analysis.\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Progression-Free Survival as Assessed by BIRC by\nTreatment Arm in ASCEND-4\nAntitumor activity of ZYKADIA in the brain was assessed in patients with measurable\ndisease as determined by the BIRC neuro-radiologist at baseline (N = 55) according\nto RECIST 1.1.\nTable 8: BIRC Assessed CNS Responses in Patients With Measurable\nCNS Lesions in ASCEND-4\nIntracranial Tumor Response\nAssessment\nZYKADIA\n(N = 28)\nChemotherapy\n(N = 27)\nOverall intracranial response rate, \n     % (95% CI)\n57% (37, 76)\n22% (9, 42)\n     Complete response, %\n7%\n7%\n     Partial response, %\n50%\n15%\nDuration of Intracranial\nResponse\n     Number of responders\nn = 16\nn = 6\n     Median in months (95% CI)\n16.6 (8.1, NE)\nNE (1.5, NE)\nAbbreviations: BIRC, Blinded Independent Review Committee; CI, confidence\ninterval; CNS, central nervous system; NE, not estimable.\nClopper and Pearson exact binomial 95% CI.\nExploratory analyses of patient-reported outcome measures suggested a delay in time\nto development of or worsening of shortness of breath in patients treated with ZYKADIA\nas compared to chemotherapy. The patient-reported delay in onset or worsening of\nshortness of breath may be an overestimation, because patients were not blinded to\na\na\ntreatment assignment.\n14.2       Previously Treated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC\nThe efficacy of ZYKADIA was evaluated in a multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical\ntrial (ASCEND-1, NCT01283516). A total of 163 patients with metastatic ALK-positive\nNSCLC who progressed while receiving or were intolerant to crizotinib were enrolled. The\nmajor efficacy outcome measure was objective response rate (ORR) according to\nRECIST v1.0 as evaluated by both investigators and BIRC. Duration of response was an\nadditional outcome measure. All patients received ZYKADIA at a dose of 750 mg once\ndaily under fasted conditions.\nThe study population characteristics were: median age 52 years, age less than 65\n(87%), female (54%), White (66%), Asian (29%), never or former smoker (97%), ECOG\nPS 0 or 1 (87%), progression on previous crizotinib (91%), number of prior therapies 2\nor more (84%), and adenocarcinoma histology (93%). Sites of extra-thoracic\nmetastases included brain (60%), liver (42%), and bone (42%).
